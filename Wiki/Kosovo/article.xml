'''Kosovo''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosovë'' / ''Kosova'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Косово и Метохија / ''Kosovo i Metohija'') is a province of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] under UN administration. It is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute between Serbia and Kosovo's majority ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] population. Between 1996 and 1999, the Yugoslav Federal Army was engaged in continous campaigns against the separatist KLA ([[Kosovar Liberation Army]]), by then considered a [[terrorist organization]] and listed as such in the [[United States Department of State]] Foreign Terrorist Organizations list until [[1998]][http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9905&amp;L=twatch-l&amp;D=1&amp;O=D&amp;F=P&amp;P=3895]. In 1999, following unilateral intervention from [[NATO]], without the [[United Nations Security Council]] previous approval, the Yugoslav Army left Kosovo. Since the conclusion of the [[Kosovo War|war]], the province has been administered by the [[United Nations]] Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo ([[UNMIK]]). Kosovo's final status has yet to be determined; talks on this issue began February 20, [[2006]].

== Geography ==
[[image:UTkosovo rel small 92.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Physical map of Kosovo]]

With an area of [[1 E10 m²|10,912]] [[square kilometre|km²]] (4,203 [[square mile|mi²]]) and a population of over two million on the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Serbia]] to the North and East; [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the south, and [[Albania]] to the southwest. The largest cities are [[Prishtinë]]/[[Pristina]] the capital, with an estimated 500,000 inhabitants, and [[Prizren]] in the southwest with 120,000: five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000.

== History ==
{{main|History of Kosovo}}
Evidence show that the region of Kosovo has been inhabited by [[List of Illyrian tribes|Illyrian tribes]] since the [[Bronze Age]]. In ancient times the area has been known as [[Dardania]] and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The [[Dardani]] were Illyrian tribes [[Albanians]]. [[Illyrians]] organised resistance against [[Greeks]] and [[Romans]] for hundreds of years but after the long wars of Illyrian tribes against intruders, the region was later occupied by the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Emperor Augustus]]. When the Roman Empire split in [[395]] A.D., the Kosovo region came under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], later known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

According to ''[[De administrando imperio]]'' the [[Slavs]], who later would form the ethnic group of [[Serbs]], came to the territories of roughly modern-day Kosovo in the [[6th century|6th]] and [[7th century|7th centuries]] during the Sllav invasions of South-Eastern Europe. 

The Ottomans invaded the realm and met the coalition of South East European nobility on [[28 June]] [[1389]], near [[Prishtina]]/[[Priština]]. The coalition consisted of only Serbs. The [[Battle of Kosovo]] followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life and the coalition was broken. Another battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by  Gjergj Kastrioti [[Skanderbeg]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops supported by the Brankovićs in [[1448]]. Skanderbeg's troops which were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the Brankovic's troops, who was more or less a Turkish [[Vassal]]. Hungarian King [[John Hunyadi]] lost the battle after a 2-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the [[Ottoman Empire]], until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in [[1459]]. 

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islamisation]] with them, particularly in towns, and also created in [[1864]] the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] as one of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territorial entities. Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the War of 1683 - 1699 with help of 5000 Albanians and their leader. It is also noted that some Serbs adopted [[Islam]] and some even gradually fused with the predominantly Albanian Moslems and adopted their culture and even language.

In 1878, with the Berlin Conference, Serbia gained what is today known as Kosova and Metohiya. 
As a response of Serbian, Bulgarians and Greeks taking about 66 percent of alb anian territory between 1878 and 1912, Albanians formed the [[League of Prizren]] in [[Prizren]]. Hundreds of Albanian leaders from all over Albania gathered and discussed the urgent issues. They successfully opposed any Serbian invasion attemps. Serbia complained to the Western Powers that the promised territories were not being handed over because Ottomans were hesitating to do so.  The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni)and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry [[Abdyl Frashëri]]. After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed or imprisoned. In 1910, an [[Albanian]] uprising spread from [[Prishtina]] and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in [[June]] [[1911]]. The Aim of the League of Prizren as to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of historically Albanian lands within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. 

In [[1912]] during the [[Balkan Wars]], Kosovo and [[Albania]] were conquered by Serbia while eastern part (called Metohija by orthodox)Kosovo was captured by [[Montenegro]]. Serbia aimed at ethnically cleansing Kosovo of its Albanian population, but it was negotiated with Turkey for the Albanians to be transferred into [[Turkey]], with relative success. In 1912, [[Albania]] declared independence and a year later, in 1913 ([[Conference of London]]), Albania was recognized as an independent state without Kosovo, as it already belonged to Serbia. In winter of 1915-16 Kosovo saw a large exodus of its Albanian population and army; hundreds of thousands soldiers had died of starvation, extreme weather and Serb reprisals as they were approaching the [[Allies]] in [[Corfu]] and [[Thessaloniki]]on their way to Turkey. 

After the [[1918]]-[[1929]] period of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and the [[1929]]-[[1941]] [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Yugoslavia was invaded by the [[Axis forces]]. The greatest part of Kosovo became a part of [[Italian]]-controlled [[Greater Albania|Fascist Albania]], and smaller bits by the [[Nazi]]-[[Fascist]] [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Tsardom of Bulgaria]] and [[Nazi]] [[Germany|German]]-occupied [[Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]]. Since the Albanians had decided in the [[Conference of Bujan]] that Kosovo would remain Albanian, they have started immediately a ethnic cleansing of the non Albanians in the occupied Kosovo. The infamous [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|SS Division Skanderbeg]] is known to committed horrible crimes. Tens of thousands of Serbs lost their lives and around 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the war. Hundreds of thousands more would leave in the following decades, following the shift of power in Kosovo.

After the war Kosovo gained the status of a province within [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In the 1974 constitution, Kosovo gained more powers and was advanced to a status of which was almost that of a republic, but not in name. It was part of a Yugoslav Federation to some extent and part of Serbia to some extent. It is disputed but there was some intention that Kosovo should become the seventh republic. For a better picture of the position of Kosovo within YU-Federation, it is best to give the example that no decision could be taken at the Federative level without the vote and consent of Kosovo. 

In 1981 Kosovar students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests were harshly attacked by the Serbian government. In 1986, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts published a document [[Memorandum]] which contained heavily Serbian nationalist rhetoric. With Serbian nationalism on the increase, [[Slobodan Milošević]] came to power. 

In 1989, following Milosevic's rise of power (especially the Gazimestan gathering, marking 600 years from the [[Battle of Kosovo]]) the autonomy of Kosovo was revoked. Most Albanians organized a peaceful resistance movement. Most Albanians were expelled from their jobs, Albanian schools and the medical care system were shut down, and Kosovo was put under an effective [[apartheid]]. On July 2, 1990 Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country. In September of that year, the parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of [[Kaçanik]], adopted the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. Two years later, Kosovo organized a referendum which was observed by international organisations but was not recognized internationally. With an 80% turnout, 98% voted for Kosovo to be independent. In the early nineties, Albanians organized a parallel state system which managed the non-violent resistance movement and organized a parallel system of education and healthcare, among other things.

With the events in Bosnia and Croatia coming to an end, the Serb government started moving Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo. In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make space for the refugees, only a few of whom remain in Kosovo today.

After the [[Dayton]] Agreement and numerous atrocities commited by Serb security forces inside Kosovo, organized into the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] and started a guerilla war for liberation. The Serb reaction was harsh in plundering Albanian villages and executing civilians. This triggered a 78-day [[NATO]] campaign. During the conflict, some 23,000 Kosovar Albanians were killed and 1,500,000 to 1,800,000 expelled. Some 9,000 Albanians are still missing. The number of Serbian soldier, policemen, and civilian deaths is considered to be around 3,000.

With the arrival of NATO, a small number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 1,000 by the UNHCR. Around 12,000 remain in Kosovo and oppose any rule by Albanians. The Serbian government usually claims that some 250,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo. 
The Status talks started in February 2006, it is set to end in the course of the year. The security of the minorites, must be provided by Kosovo Albanian goverments, but it is disputed if the Kosovo Albanian Institutions can grant theese guarantees. The [[E.U.]] has said that they will raise its demands for an independent Kosovo.

==Disputes over language, culture and citizenship==
The territory is most widely known as 'Kosove' and this has become the standard in international and United Nations usage. In [[Albanian language|Albanian]] this name becomes 'Kosova', which is more often found within Kosove and in official use by the Provisional Institutions, though both Albanian and German are the only languages in use. 

The question of what to call the inhabitants of Kosovo collectively has also aroused debate. The two words accepted by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] are &quot;Kosovar&quot; (borrowed from Albanian), the most widely used variant in English, by far, and &quot;Kosovar&quot; . 
As for language and citizenship, so for cultural and political symbols. Kosovo had its own flag, when it used to have a province status within former Yugoslavia. The former province of Kosovo was identified with a flag similar to the one of Albania, but had a large star on the right-handside. The [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]] is used unofficially by the Kosovo Albanian-dominated administration and the vast majority of Kosovo Albanians; although recently the [[:Image:Kosovo Presidential Flag.gif|flag of the presidency]] is being used as an unofficial flag of Kosovo, as could be seen during [[Ibrahim Rugova]]'s funeral [http://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Rugova].

The Serb-inhabited area of north Kosovo uses only the [[flag of Serbia]], which is formally the flag of Serbia, although this usage is rejected by virtually all Kosovo Albanians and other smaller minorities apart from Serbs and some Roma.

== Politics and international status ==
Kosovo's international status is anomalous. The administration is presently conducted by the [[United Nations]] with little or no involvement on the part of the Serbian government (under Security Council resolution 1244 of [[10 June]] [[1999]]; see [http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/1999/sc99.htm Security Council Resolutions 1999]).  The supervision of the government of Kosovo is the responsibility of the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK). Under the terms of the [[Kumanovo agreement]] and subsequent UN [[Security Council]] [[Resolution 1244]], which ended the [[Kosovo War]], security is provided by the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which is led by [[NATO]] and is answerable to UNMIK.

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
UNMIK has so far established a provisional assembly, provisional government and the office of provisional president, which are legislative and executive bodies under UNMIK's control. Control of security, justice and external affairs are still under full UNMIK control. Elections for the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] were held in November [[2001]] and again in [[2004]] and were qualified as the most democratic elections in the Balkans. [[Ibrahim Rugova]] was elected as president in March [[2002]]. The seat of the assembly, government and president is in [[Prishtina]]/[[Pristina]]. So far, the parliament has enacted and UNMIK approved a constitutional framework, customs code, two criminal codes and some 200 laws.

The Constitutional Framework enacted by the Kosovo Assembly (with UN Security Council approval) has adopted a policy of [[affirmative action]] in the assembly to ensure that Kosovo's minorities are properly represented. Out of 120 seats, 10 are reserved for Serbs and another 10 for non-Albanian minorities, while the remaining 100 seats are elected through direct voting. UNMIK does not take account, though, the Serbs and other non-Albanians who have left Kosovo as a result of interethnic tension, many of whom are unable to reclaim lost property or safely to attend elections. The process of 'returns' of these displaced persons has yet to begin in earnest, as a result of insufficient funding and a perceived inability of the UN to control violence against minority groups, as well as a concern on the part of Kosovo Albanians that an increased number of Serbs will undermine the chances for an independent Kosovo.

The international community is becoming less and less to see Kosovo remain dependent, as last Contact Group and UN Security Council meetings showed. But once status is resolved, and Kosovo has access to international monetary institutions the economic development will be possible.  In early 2006, western diplomants have come out clearly in support of an independent Kosovo, with guarantees for the minorities. 

UNMIK is issuing travel documents which serve instead of [[passport]]s in countries which recognise them, and issues identity cards and car plates, which again are valid only in certain countries. The airspace and borders of Kosovo are controlled by KFOR.

The European Union runs the Kosovo economy in cooperation with the Kosovar institutions. The EU has initiated the Stabilisation Tracking Mechanism, a special and separate track of EU integration for Kosovo. 

On [[January 21]], [[2006]], the President of Kosovo, Dr.[[Ibrahim Rugova]], died at age 61.  On [[February 10]], 2006, [[Fatmir Sejdiu]] was elected to be the second President by an 80-12 vote in parliament. On [[March 10]], 2006, [[Agim Çeku]] was appointed as the Prime Minister of Kosovo, during a voting by the Assembly of Kosovo. Çeku is a [[Lieutenant General]] and has served in [[Yugoslav]] and [[Croatian]] armies, eventually coming back to Kosovo to head the [[KLA]] and subsequentlt served as a Commander of the [[KPC]].

== Economy ==
[[UNMIK]] declared the [[euro]] to be the official currency of the province in [[2001]] in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the [[Deutschmark]], which had become the ''de facto'' currency even before the 1999 war. However, the [[Serbian dinar]] remains an official currency, used principally in the [[Kosovo Serb enclaves]]; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro; Kosovo's administration uses the euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the [[United States dollar]] and [[Swiss franc]] are the most widespread.

== Demographics ==
Ethnic Albanians comprise almost 99% of the population of the province. In the aftermath of the conflict some one thousand non-Albanians, particularly [[Serbs]] and [[Roma]] either followed Serb soldiers as they withdrew, (note:Most of Kosovo Serbs were in the ruling administration of Milosevic's installed apartheid in Kosovo). 
According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo[http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf], Kosovo's total population is estimated between 2,1 and 2,5 million in the following ethnic proportions:
* 99% [[Albanians]] (between 2,184,000 and 2,533,600) 
* 3% [[Serbs]] (between 16,000 and 14,000)	
* 1% [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] and [[Bosniaks]]
