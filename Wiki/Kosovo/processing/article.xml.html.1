<p>]The last disputed region of the now defunct communist Yugoslavia, the province of Kosovo has an extensive and rich history. Inhabited by several different groups, it was initially (circa 1300 B.C.E.) inhabited by[ <a href='Illyrians'>]Illyrians[<\/a> ](predecessors of Albanians), which eventually became incorporated into the Roman empire and subsequently the Byzantine empire. From c. 6th century AD it was settled by[ <a href='Slavs'>]Slavs[<\/a> ](Serbians) migrating from the north. It was conquered by the Ottoman empire during their take-over of south-eastern Europe. However, it was regained by the Serbs after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in the 1912-13[ <a href='Balkan Wars'>]Balkan Wars[<\/a>].[  ]Kosovo has since been a region or province of modern Yugoslavia and its successor state of Serbia..[][<\/p>

]The Kosovo region has been taken, retaken, and ruled by several empires. It lies both on the outer fringes of the[ <a href='Byzantine Empire'>]Byzantine Empire[<\/a> ]and directly in the path of[ <a href='Slavs|Slavic'>]Slavs|Slavic[<\/a> ]invasions in the[ <a href='5th century|5th'>]5th century|5th[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='6th century|6th'>]6th century|6th[<\/a> ]centuries, culminating with the arrival of[ <a href='White Serbs'>]White Serbs[<\/a> ]in the first half of the[ <a href='7th century|7th'>]7th century|7th[<\/a> ]who formed the realm of[ <a href='Rascia'>]Rascia[<\/a>], the center of which was in northwest Kosovo. From[ <a href='863'>]863[<\/a> ]to[ <a href='971'>]971[<\/a>], most of the remainder of Kosovo was ruled by[ <a href='Bulgaria'>]Bulgaria[<\/a>], cementing the[ <em>]slavic[<\/em> ]character of Kosovo. Various Slavic rebellions wanted to restore the Bulgarian Empire, like the one from Macedonia in[ <a href='976'>]976[<\/a> ]to[ <a href='1014'>]1014[<\/a> ]or the one raised in the 1040s. The Serbs from[ <a href='Doclea'>]Doclea[<\/a> ]also tried in[ <a href='1070'>]1070[<\/a> ]to[ <a href='1072'>]1072[<\/a> ]to restore the Bulgarian Empire, but they were defeated in the Battle of Sitnica. From the 1090s, most of Kosovo is incorporated into the Grand Principality of Rascia under the[ <a href='VojislavljeviÄ|VukanoviÄ'>]VojislavljeviÄ|VukanoviÄ[<\/a> ]family. Although it would not be until[ <a href='1208'>]1208[<\/a> ]that Grand Prince Stefan NemanjiÄ would finally conquer[ <a href='Prizren'>]Prizren[<\/a> ]that Kosovo got fully incorporated into Serbia..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]During the rule of the[ <a href='NemanjiÄ'>]NemanjiÄ[<\/a> ]dynasty, many[ <a href='Serbian Orthodox'>]Serbian Orthodox[<\/a> ]churches and monasteries were built throughout Kosovo. Kosovo became the core of the Serbian realm in the second half of the 13th and in the 14th century; the[ <a href='NemanjiÄ'>]NemanjiÄ[<\/a> ]rulers alternatively used both[ <a href='Prizren'>]Prizren[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>]PriÅ¡tina[<\/a> ]as their capitals. Large estates were given to the monasteries in Metohija (Western Kosovo) (which included parts of modern-day Albania and Montenegro). The most prominent churches in Kosovo - the[ <a href='Patriarchate'>]Patriarchate[<\/a> ]at[ <a href='Pec'>]Pec[<\/a>], the church at[ <a href='GraÄanica'>]GraÄanica[<\/a> ]and the monastery at[ <a href='Visoki DeÄani'>]Visoki DeÄani[<\/a> ]near[ <a href='DeÄani'>]DeÄani[<\/a> ]- were all adopted during this period. At the end of the 13th century, Pec became the center of the[ <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>]Serbian Orthodox Church[<\/a>], which became a Patriarchate in[ <a href='1346'>]1346[<\/a>]. Kosovo was economically important, as the modern Kosovo capital[ <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>]PriÅ¡tina[<\/a> ]was a major trading centre on routes leading to ports on the[ <a href='Adriatic Sea'>]Adriatic Sea[<\/a>]. As well, mining was an important industry in[ <a href='Novo Brdo'>]Novo Brdo[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Janjevo'>]Janjevo[<\/a> ]which had its communities of Ã©migrÃ©[ <a href='Saxons|Saxon'>]Saxons|Saxon[<\/a> ]miners and[ <a href='Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan'>]Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan[<\/a> ]merchants..[][<\/p>
<p>]Ethnic identity from the[ <a href='Middle Ages'>]Middle Ages[<\/a> ]was somewhat fluid throughout Europe, and people at that time do not appear to have defined themselves rigidly by a single ethnic identity. Those of Slavic origin, particularly of the Serbian background, appear to have been the dominant population culturally and were probably a demographic majority as well..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]In the second half of the 14th century the Serbian Empire fell into feudal anarchy on the death of[ <a href='Tsar'>]Tsar[<\/a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>]Stefan DuÅ¡an[<\/a> ]and local fiefdoms rose to power and prominence in their respective lands, with Kosovo becoming a Lordship under the[ <a href='BrankoviÄ'>]BrankoviÄ[<\/a> ]dynasty. The Ottoman Emirate took the opportunity to exploit Serbian weakness and invaded, with the epic[ <a href='Battle of Kossovo'>]Battle of Kossovo[<\/a> ]occurring in[ <a href='1389'>]1389[<\/a>]. In[ <a href='1455'>]1455[<\/a>], the Ottoman Empire conquered Kosovo from Serbia..[][<\/p>
<a name="Ottoman_Empire"><\/a><h3>]Ottoman Empire.[][<\/h3><p>]{{seealso|Vilayet of Kosovo}}[
]{{seealso|History of Ottoman Serbia}}.[][<\/p>
<p>]The[ <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>]Ottoman Empire|Ottomans[<\/a> ]brought[ <a href='Islamisation'>]Islamisation[<\/a> ]with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the[ <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>]Vilayet of Kosovo[<\/a> ]as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Ottoman rule lasted for about 500 years, in which time the Ottomans were the absolute paramount power in the region. Many Christians adopted Islam, particularly many Bosnians and Albanians, whose populations became predominantly Islamic. The Ottomans administered through a[ <em>]millet[<\/em> ]system whereby Muslim subjects received more tax concessions and personal liberties compared to Christians and Jews[ &lt;]ref[&gt; ]The Balkans: from Constantinople to Communsim. Dennis P Hupchick[ &lt;]\/ref[&gt;]..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]Kosovo was taken temporarily by the Austrian forces during the War of[ <a href='1683'>]1683[<\/a>&amp;]ndash;[<a href='1699'>]1699[<\/a> ]with help of Serbs. After the Austrians retreated, many Serbs had to flee from Kosovo to evade Ottoman reprisals. In[ <a href='1690'>]1690[<\/a>], the[ <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>]Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ[<\/a> <a href='Arsenije III'>]Arsenije III[<\/a>], who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade[ <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>]Ottoman Empire|Ottoman[<\/a> ]wrath. The people that followed him were mostly[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]âbut they were likely followed by Christians of other ethnic backgrounds..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]The Albanian people of the area also continued to intermittently struggle against occupation, yet suffered less reprisals at the hands of the Ottomans. Quite a few rose to prominence in the Turkish system, as administrators and as soldiers. During this time, many Albanians moved into Kosovo, filling in lands and houses vacated by fleeing Christians[ &lt;]ref[&gt; ]the Balkans: from Constantinople to Communism[ &lt;]\/ref[&gt;]. Whilst relations between Serbs and Albanians were peaceful initially, this eventually deteriorated. At the outset, Christians and Muslim-converts celebrated each other's religious holidays together. However, later, many young Albanian Islamics participated in Turkish massacres of Christians[ &lt;]ref[&gt; ]Alex Dragnich and Slavko Todorovich. Serbs and Albanians Under Turkish Rule[ &lt;]\/ref[&gt;], which in turn would be retaliated upon by the Serbs when they got the upper hand. This period has by many been identified as the catalyst of the subsequent deterioration of the relationship between Serbian and Albanian peoples. Apart from religious tensions, the subsequent political outlook changed for the two people. As the Ottoman empire began to collapse, Serbia aimed to re-incorporate Kosovo into the heart of its realm, whereas many Albanians were content with their new-found authority within the Ottoman system..[][<\/p>
<p>]With ongoing oppression from the Ottomans, migrations of Christian people out of Kosovo continued until the Ottoman empire finally collapsed. Many Serbs (and Vlachs) moved to Vojvodina and the Krajina region. Also, many of the minority of Albanians that remained Christian also migrated to towns in Dalmatia..[][<\/p>

]During the 19th Century part of modern Kosovo was reintegrated into 'Old Serbia' following a Peace Accord of 1878 which brought the cities of PriÅ¡tina and Kosovska Mitrovica under Serbian control whilst leaving the remainder of Kosovo under Ottoman authority. An ethnic-Albanian Prizren League was formed which sought to unite all of the Albanian provinces of the Ottoman Empire, but which was ultimately defeated by Ottoman forces. During the[ <a href='First Balkan War'>]First Balkan War[<\/a> ]of[ <a href='1912'>]1912[<\/a> ]most of Kosovo was retaken by the[ <a href='Kingdom of Serbia'>]Kingdom of Serbia[<\/a> ]while the region of Metohija (know as the Dukagjini Valley to ethnic-Albanians) was taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro. Populations of ethnic Serbs and Albanians tended to shift following territorial conquests..[][<\/p>
<p>]During World War I, Kosovo was occupied by the Bulgarian and Austro-Hungarian forces following a serious defeat of Serbian and allied armies in 1915. Returning in 1918, the Serbian army pushed the central powers out of Kosovo as the war came to a close. Following WWI, the[ <a href='Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'>]Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes[<\/a> ]was formed, bringing together Serbian Kosovo and Montenegrin Metohija within the new kingdom. The partition of Yugoslavia by the invading[ <a href='Axis Powers'>]Axis Powers[<\/a> ]from 1941 and 1945 awarded most of the territory to the Italian-occupied[ <a href='Greater Albania'>]Greater Albania[<\/a>], and a smaller part of it to[ <a href='Nazi Germany|German'>]Nazi Germany|German[<\/a>]-occupied Serbia and[ <a href='Greater Bulgaria'>]Greater Bulgaria[<\/a>]. Both wars were occasions for inter-ethnic violence and both voluntary and forced population shifts..[][<\/p>
<p>]Following the end of the war and the establishment of[ <a href='Tito'>]Tito[<\/a>]'s[ <a href='Communist'>]Communist[<\/a> ]regime, Kosovo-which had been a region of Serbia- was granted the status of an autonomous region of Yugoslavia in[ <a href='1946'>]1946[<\/a> ]and became an autonomous province in[ <a href='1963'>]1963[<\/a>]. This was done by Tito to weaken Serbia's dominance of Yugoslavia, in an effort to make Yugoslavia more equal- " a weak Serbia equals a strong Yugoslavia". With the passing of the[ <a href='1974'>]1974[<\/a> ]Yugoslavia constitution, Kosovo gained self-government. Schooling and university were provided in Albanian language - an unprecedented provision for an ethnic minority. Despite this, Kosovo had the highest unemployment rate in all Yugoslavia, particularly amongst the Albanians. At the same time they had the highest birth rate in all of Europe..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]Throughout the[ <a href='1980s'>]1980s[<\/a> ]tensions between the Albanian and Serb communities in the province escalated, undoubtedly in part due to the social situation of Albanian's in the region.[&lt;]ref name="reuters19860527"[&gt;]Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;&lt;]ref name="csm19860728"[&gt;]Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"[&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]By now, Albanians were a clear majority in Kosovo, the final result of centuries of Serbian exodus out of Kosovo, which commenced in Ottoman times and continued throught the 20th century as a reaction to the backward socio-economic status of Kosovo as well as harassment and outright murder of Serbian civilians by the hands of Albanians. The Albanian community favoured greater autonomy for Kosovo, whilst Serbs favoured closer ties with the rest of Serbia. There was little appetite for unification with Albania itself, which was ruled by a[ <a href='Stalinist'>]Stalinist[<\/a> ]government and had considerably worse living standards than Kosovo. Beginning in March[ <a href='1981'>]1981[<\/a>], Kosovo Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities"[&lt;]ref name="nyt19810419"[&gt;]New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"[&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. In the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Serbian government declared that Albanians were committing genocide against Serbian people..[][<\/p>
<p>]Serbs living in Kosovo complained of discrimination from the provincial Kosovo government (run by the ethnic-Albanian dominated Communist Party of Kosovo)[&lt;]ref name="nyt19820712"[&gt;]New York Times 1982-07-12, "Exodus of Serbians Stirs Province in Yugoslavia"[&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]and neglect from the Federal authorities in Belgrade.[&lt;]ref name="nyt19870627"[&gt;]New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"[&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]In August[ <a href='1987'>]1987[<\/a>], during the dying days of Yugoslavia's Communist regime, Kosovo was visited by[ <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>]Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ[<\/a>], then a rising politician. MiloÅ¡eviÄ capitalised on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia. In a staged event, having drawn huge crowds to a rally commemorating the Battle of Kosovo, he pledged to Kosovo Serbs that "No one should dare to beat you", and became an instant hero of Kosovo's Serbs.[&lt;]ref[&gt;]http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/SPECIALS\/2000\/kosovo\/stories\/past\/milosevic\/[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;&lt;]ref[&gt;]The Economist, June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, What's next for Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ?[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;   ]By the end of the year MiloÅ¡eviÄ was in control of the Serbian government..[][<\/p>
<p>]In[ <a href='1989'>]1989[<\/a>], the autonomy of both Kosovo and of[ <a href='Vojvodina'>]Vojvodina[<\/a> ]were drastically reduced by a new Serbian constitution which allowed a[ <a href='multi-party system'>]multi-party system[<\/a>], introduced[ <a href='freedom of speech'>]freedom of speech[<\/a> ]and promoted[ <a href='human rights'>]human rights[<\/a>]. Though later subverted by[ <a href='MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>]MiloÅ¡eviÄ[<\/a>]'s abuses, the new constitution was a significant step forward from the previous Communist constitution. However, the new constitution[ 
]also significantly reduced the rights of the two previously autonomous provinces, giving control of many areas directly to the Government of Serbia, including control of the police, the court system, the economy, the education system and language policies. Differing viewpoints see either an attempt to gain control of a crisis-ridden province or a cynical exploitation of nationalist politics[&lt;]ref name="reuters19880730"[&gt;]Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;]. When called to ratify the new constitution in March[ <a href='1989'>]1989[<\/a>], the assemblies of the provinces were met with tanks and armoured cars, effectively forcing the delegates to accept the amendments. Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On[ <a href='July 2'>]July 2[<\/a> <a href='1990'>]1990[<\/a>], an unofficial Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo independent, though this move was recognised only by[ <a href='Albania'>]Albania[<\/a>]. In[ <a href='1992'>]1992[<\/a>], the parliament organised an unofficial referendum, observed by international organizations{{Fact|date=July 2007}} not recognized internationally, which saw a 98% vote of the Kosovo Albanian majority for independence..[][<\/p>
<a name="Kosovo_War"><\/a><h4>]Kosovo War.[][<\/h4><p>]{{main|Kosovo War}}.[][<\/p>
<p>]Under the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova, the Albanians in Kosovo conducted a peaceful resistance to Serb rule. In 1995, after the[ <a href='Dayton Agreement'>]Dayton Agreement[<\/a> ]which ended the Bosnian War, but did not address Kosovo, many Albanians became disenchanted with Rugova's peaceful strategy.[  ]Consequently, the[ <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>]Kosovo Liberation Army[<\/a> ](KLA) was formed in 1996 with the goal of attaining an independent Kosovo.[  ]Other KLA factions fought with the goal of uniting all the Albanian populated lands and some simply to defend Kosovo Albanians from[ <a href='Milosevic'>]Milosevic[<\/a>]'s regime, but they were joined together by the common objective of defeating what they saw as Serb oppressors. They employed guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and paramilitaries.[  ]Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims..[][<\/p>
<p>
