<strong>Kosovo</strong> <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a>: <em>KosovÃ«</em> or <em>Kosova</em>) is a province in southern <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> which has been under <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|administration'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|administration</a> since <a href='1999'>1999</a>. While Serbia's nominal <a href='sovereignty'>sovereignty</a> is recognised by the international community, in practice Serbian governance in the province is virtually non-existent (see also <a href='Constitutional status of Kosovo'>Constitutional status of Kosovo</a>). The province is governed by the <a href='United Nations Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) and the local <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a>, with security provided by the <a href='NATO'>NATO</a>-led <a href='Kosovo Force'>Kosovo Force</a> (KFOR).</p>
<p>

<p>The province is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the <a href='Yugoslavia|Yugoslav'>Yugoslavia|Yugoslav</a>) government and Kosovo's Albanian population. International negotiations began in <a href='2006'>2006</a> to determine the final status of Kosovo (<em>See <a href='Kosovo Status Process'>Kosovo Status Process</a></em>).

Illyrians resisted rule by the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading empires, the region was eventually occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a> in <a href='28 BC|28&amp;nbsp;BC'>28 BC|28&amp;nbsp;BC</a>; it is not clear whether it was part of the province of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a> or was divided between <a href='Dalmatia'>Dalmatia</a> and Moesia (a view which is supported by some archaeological evidence).&lt;ref name="Jankovic"/&gt; Emperor <a href='Diocletian'>Diocletian</a> later (<a href='Circa|c.'>Circa|c.</a><a href='284'>284</a>) made Dardania into a separate province with its capital at <a href='Naissus'>Naissus</a> (<a href='NiÅ¡'>NiÅ¡</a>).

<a name="Medieval"></a><h3>Medieval</h3><a name="Great_migrations_and_interregnums"></a><h4>Great migrations and interregnums</h4><p><a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> came to the territories that form modern Kosovo in the <a href='7th century|seventh-century'>7th century|seventh-century</a> migrations of <a href='White Serbs'>White Serbs</a> under the <a href='Arsenije III ÄarnojeviÄ'>Arsenije III ÄarnojeviÄ</a>, with the largest influx of migrants in the 630s; although the region was increasingly populated by Slavs since the sixth or even fifth century. These Slavs were <a href='Christianization|Christianized'>Christianization|Christianized</a> in several waves between the <a href='7th century|seventh'>7th century|seventh</a> and <a href='9th century|ninth century'>9th century|ninth century</a>, with the last wave taking place between <a href='867'>867</a> and <a href='874'>874</a>. The northwestern part of Kosovo, <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, became a part of the Byzantine <a href='Serb'>Serb</a> vassal state the <a href='Principality of Rascia'>Principality of Rascia</a>, with <a href='Desnik|Dostinik'>Desnik|Dostinik</a> as the principality's capital.</p>
<p>In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire</a>. Although <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> restored control over <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> throughout the <a href='10th century|tenth century'>10th century|tenth century</a>, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire in a period of Bulgarian decline. However, Tsar <a href='Samuil of Bulgaria'>Samuil of Bulgaria</a> reconquered the whole of Kosovo in the late tenth century until the Byzantines restored their control over the area as they subjugated the Bulgarian Empire. In 1040-1041, Bulgarians, led by the Samuil of Bulgaria's grandson Petar Delyan staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantine control over the region continued.</p>
<p> 
Throughout the following decades, numerous foreign peoples invading the Byzantine Empire stormed Kosovo, among them the <a href='Cumans'>Cumans</a>.</p>
<p> 
In 1072, local Bulgarians, under George Voiteh, pushed a final attempt to restore Imperial Bulgarian power and invited the last heir of the <a href='House of Comitopuli'>House of Comitopuli</a> - <a href='Duklja'>Duklja</a>'s prince <a href='Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin'>Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin</a> of the <a href='House of Vojislavljevic'>House of Vojislavljevic</a>, son of the <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Mihailo Voislav'>Mihailo Voislav</a> - to assume power. The Serbs decided to conquer the entire Byzantine region of Bulgaria. King Mihailo dispatched his son with three hundred elite Serb fighters led by Duke Petrilo. Constantine Bodin was crowned in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> as <em>Petar III</em>, <a href='List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians'>List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians</a> by George Voiteh and the Slavic Boyars. The Empire swept across Byzantine territories in months, until the significant losses on the south had forced Czar Petar to withdraw. In 1073, the Byzantine forces chased Constantine Bodin, defeated his army at <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a>, and imprisoned him.</p>
<a name="Incorporation_into_Serbia"></a><h4>Incorporation into Serbia</h4><p>The full Serbian takeover was carried out under a branch of the <a href='House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav'>House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav</a> <a href='Grand Prince'>Grand Princes</a> of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a>. In <a href='1093'>1093</a>, Prince Vukan advanced on <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The Byzantine Emperor himself came to <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a> for negotiations. ZveÄan served as the Byzantine line-of-defence against constant invasions from the neighboring Serbs. A peace agreement was made, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. Vukan's armies stormed Kosovo. In <a href='1094'>1094</a>, <a href='Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius'>Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius</a> attempted to renew peace negotiations in Ulpiana. A new peace agreement was concluded and Vukan handed over hostages to the Emperor, including his two nephews UroÅ¡ and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the conflict in <a href='1106'>1106</a>, once again defeating John Comnenus' army. However, his death halted the total Serb conquest of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In <a href='1166'>1166</a>, a Serbian nobleman from <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a>, <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>Stefan Nemanja</a>, the founder of the <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja</a> ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a>. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the <a href='Sitnica'>Sitnica</a> river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in <a href='1183'>1183</a>, Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the <a href='Hungarians'>Hungarians</a> after the death of <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a> in <a href='1180'>1180</a>, marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Nemanja's son, <a href='Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II'>Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II</a>, recorded that the border of the Serbian realm reached the river of Lab. Grand Prince Stephen II completed the inclusion of the Kosovo territories under Serb rule in 1208, by which time he had conquered Prizren and Lipljan, and moved the border of territory under his control to the Å ar mountain.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_the_Serbs"></a><h4>Kingdom of the Serbs</h4><p>In <a href='1217'>1217</a>, the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom'>History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom</a> achieved recognition. In <a href='1219'>1219</a>, an autocephalous <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was created, with <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, Prizren and Lipljan being the Orthodox Christian <a href='Episcopates'>Episcopates</a> on Kosovo. By the end of the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, the centre of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church</a> was moved to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> from <a href='Å½iÄa'>Å½iÄa</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href='13th century|thirteenth century'>13th century|thirteenth century</a>, Kosovo became the heart of the Serbian political and religious life, with the Å ar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was in Pauni. On an island was <a href='SvrÄin'>SvrÄin</a>, and on the coast <a href='Å timlji'>Å timlji</a>, and in the mountains was the Castle of <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating, and as the rulers' living quarters. After 1291, the Tartars broke all the way to PeÄ. <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a> managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the <a href='Mother of Christ'>Mother of Christ</a> of LjeviÅ¡ka in Prizren around 1307, which became the seat of the Prizren Episcopric, and the magnificent <a href='GraÄanica'>GraÄanica</a> in 1335, the seat of the Lipljan Episcopric. In 1331, the juvenile King DuÅ¡an attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in Nerodimlje. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of <a href='PetriÄ'>PetriÄ</a>, but DuÅ¡an captured him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palailogos and their children in ZveÄan, where the dethroned King died on <a href='11 November'>11 November</a> <a href='1331'>1331</a>.</p>
<p>In 1327 and 1328, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani started forming the vast DeÄani domain, although, Serbian King DuÅ¡an would finish it in 1335. Stefan of Dechani issued the Dechani Charter in 1330, listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne.</p>
<a name="Serbian_Empire_and_Despotate"></a><h4>Serbian Empire and Despotate</h4><p><a href='Monarch|King'>Monarch|King</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archaengel near Prizren in <a href='1342'>1342</a>-<a href='1352'>1352</a>. The Kingdom was transformed into an <a href='Serbian Empire|Empire'>Serbian Empire|Empire</a> in 1345 and officially in 1346. Stefan DuÅ¡an received <a href='John VI Cantacuzenus'>John VI Cantacuzenus</a> in <a href='1342'>1342</a> in his Castle in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In <a href='1346'>1346</a>, the Serbian <a href='Archbishopric|Archepiscopric'>Archbishopric|Archepiscopric</a> at PeÄ was upgraded into a <a href='Patriarchate'>Patriarchate</a>, but it was not recognized before <a href='1370'>1370</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the Empire fell into disarray prior to DuÅ¡an's death in <a href='1355'>1355</a>, feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar <a href='Stefan UroÅ¡ V'>Stefan UroÅ¡ V</a>. Kosovo became a domain of the <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ</a>, but Prince Voislav VoinoviÄ expanded his demesne further into Kosovo. The armies of King <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ</a> from <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a> and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in <a href='1369'>1369</a>, putting a halt to his advances. After the <a href='Battle of Marica'>Battle of Marica</a> on <a href='26 September'>26 September</a> <a href='1371'>1371</a>, in which the MrnjavÄeviÄ brothers lost their lives, <a href='House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ'>House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ</a> of <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a> took Prizren and PeÄ in <a href='1372'>1372</a>. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the <a href='Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ'>Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> invaded and met the Christian coalition of Serbs, Albanians and Vlahcs under <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> on <a href='28 June'>28 June</a> <a href='1389'>1389</a>, near <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a>, at Gazi Mestan. The Serbian Army was assisted by various allies. The epic <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the Ottomans had 140,000. Through the cunning of <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a>, <a href='Sultan'>Sultan</a> <a href='Murad I|Murad'>Murad I|Murad</a> was murdered and the new Sultan <a href='Beyazid'>Beyazid</a> had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> and <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> were canonised by the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> for their efforts in the battle. The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by the Albanian ruler Gjergj Kastrioti <a href='Skanderbeg'>Skanderbeg</a> on one side, and Ottoman troops supported by the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄs</a> in <a href='1448'>1448</a>. Skanderbeg's troops that were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the BrankoviÄ's troops, who was more or less a Turkish <a href='Vassal'>Vassal</a>. Hungarian King <a href='John Hunyadi'>John Hunyadi</a> lost the battle after a two-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the Ottoman Empire, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in 1459.</p>
<p> 
In 1455, new castles rose to prominence in PriÅ¡tina and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, centres of the Ottoman vassalaged House of BrankoviÄ.</p>
<p>This would be a great article for Serbia's history. Perhaps you should move it there. Mind you this is Kosova's article, this all is meaninglessly overweighting Serbia's history, and its correlating the two seperate histories, giving too much emphasis on the Serbian history, as yet theres still no mention of native Albanians who still lived here.</p>
<a name="Ottoman_rule"></a><h3>Ottoman rule</h3><p>{{main|Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire}}
The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> brought <a href='Islamisation'>Islamisation</a> with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the <a href='Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Kosovo'>Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Kosovo</a> as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. This brought a great shift, as the Orthodox Serb population began to lose its majority when large numbers of <a href='Turkic peoples|Turks'>Turkic peoples|Turks</a> moved to Kosovo. During the Islamisation, many Churches and Holy Orthodox Christian places were destroyed or turned into Mosques. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren was torn down at the end of the sixteenth century and the material used to build the Mosque of Sinan-pasha, an Islamized Serb, in Prizren. Although the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was officially abolished in 1532, an Islamized Serb from Bosnia, Vizier <a href='Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ'>Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ</a> influenced the restoration of the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> in 1557. Special privileges were provided, which helped the survival of Serbs and other Christians in Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the <a href='Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (1683â1699)|Great War of 1683-1699'>Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (1683â1699)|Great War of 1683-1699</a> with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a <a href='Catholic Archibishop'>Catholic Archibishop</a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion.

It is also noted that some <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> adopted <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>, while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanians, adopting their culture and even language.

<p>In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of <a href='Christians'>Christians</a> in Kosovo was greatly reduced.

<p>Albanians never came to Kosova, they were always there, oppressed by whomever wenth through here, including Serbian Kingdom/governmets aswell.</p>
<p>Theres no mention of the Great Albanian League in Prizren, that was held in 1878. And again theres no need to over emphasize the serbian perspective cause there was no Serb rule in Kosova at this time, it was Turks.</p>

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>
<p>  
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>.  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>7</a> ", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>8</a> ", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a name="Kosovo_Status_Process"></a><h3>Kosovo Status Process</h3><p>{{current event}}
{{main|Kosovo Status Process}}
{{seealso|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
A UN-led political process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status.  Belgrade has proposed that Kosovo be highly autonomous and remain a part of Serbia â Belgrade officials have repeatedly said that an imposition of Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and therefore contrary to international law. Pristina asserts that Kosovo should become independent, arguing that the violence of the Milosevic years has made continued union between Kosovo and Serbia not viable.</p>
<p>  
UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, former <a href='president of Finland'>president of Finland</a>, leads the status process; <a href='Austria'>Austrian</a> diplomat Albert Rohan is his deputy.  Ahtisaari's office â the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) â is located in <a href='Vienna'>Vienna</a> and includes liaison staff from <a href='NATO'>NATO</a>, the <a href='European Union|EU'>European Union|EU</a> and the United States.</p>
<p>  
On <a href='February 2'>February 2</a>, <a href='2007'>2007</a>, UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari delivered to Belgrade and Pristina leaders a draft status settlement proposal.  The proposal covered a wide range of issues related to Kosovo's future, in particular measures to protect Kosovo's non-Albanian communities such as decentralization of government, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional protections for non-Albanian communities.  While not mentioning the word "independence," the draft included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo.  In particular, the draft Settlement would give Kosovo the right to apply for membership in international organizations, create a Kosovo Security Force and adopt national symbols.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070202/ts_afp/serbiakosovounstatusproposal_070202162726;_ylt=Ap9g4N..BOD23p6b5WY2sqsXxHcA;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl UN envoy seeks multi-ethnic, self-governing Kosovo'>9</a> ", <em>Agence France-Presse</em> (AFP), Vienna, February 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahtisaari conducted several weeks of consultations with the parties in Vienna to finalize the Settlement, including a high-level meeting on March 10 that brought together the Presidents and Prime Ministers of both sides.  After this meeting, leaders from both sides signaled a total unwillingness to compromise on their central demands (Pristina for Kosovo's independence; Belgrade for sovereignty over Kosovo). Concluding that there was no chance for the two sides to reconcile their positions, Ahtisaari said he would submit to the UN Security Council his own proposed status arrangements, including an explicit recommendation for the status outcome itself, by the end of March. &lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070310/wl_nm/serbia_kosovo1_dc_4;_ylt=AvL5xEUliSVd9RrxZLjpSI8XxHcA

{{main|Economy of Kosovo}}
Kosovo has one of the most under-developed economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at <a href='Euro|â¬'>Euro|â¬1</a>,565 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html worldbank.org'>14</a>&lt;/ref&gt; Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, "Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries"&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, international sanctions, poor external commerce and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html worldbank.org'>15</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in <a href='Gross Domestic Product'>Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. <a href='Inflation'>Inflation</a> is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP.

<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
