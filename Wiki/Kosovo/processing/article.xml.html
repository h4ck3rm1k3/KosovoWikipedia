Its south was ruled by <a href='Macedon'>Macedon</a> since <a href='Alexander the Great'>Alexander the Great</a>'s reign in the <a href='4th century BC'>4th century BC</a>. Illyrians resisted rule by the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading empires, the region was eventually occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a> in <a href='28 BC'>28 BC</a>; it is not clear whether it was part of the province of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a> or was divided between <a href='Dalmatia'>Dalmatia</a> and Moesia (a view which is supported by some archaeological evidence).&lt;ref name=Jankovic/&gt; Emperor <a href='Diocletian'>Diocletian</a> later (c. <a href='284'>284</a>) made Dardania into a separate province with its capital at <a href='Naissus'>Naissus</a> (<a href='NiÅ¡'>NiÅ¡</a>). When the Roman Empire split in <a href='Anno Domini|A.D.'>Anno Domini|A.D.</a> <a href='395'>395</a>, the area came under the <a href='Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire'>Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire</a>, the <a href='Byzantine Empire'>Byzantine Empire</a>.

<a name="Medieval"></a><h3>Medieval</h3><a name="Great_Migrations_and_Interregnums"></a><h4>Great Migrations and Interregnums</h4><p><a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> came to the territories that form modern Kosovo in the <a href='7th century|7th centuries'>7th century|7th centuries</a> migrations of <a href='White Serbs'>White Serbs</a> under the <a href='Unknown Archont'>Unknown Archont</a>, with the largest influx of migrants in the 630s; although the region was increasingly populated by Slavs since the 6th or even 5th century. These Slavs were <a href='Christianization|Christianized'>Christianization|Christianized</a> in several waves between the <a href='7th century|7th'>7th century|7th</a> and <a href='9th century'>9th century</a>, with the last wave taking place between <a href='867'>867</a> and <a href='874'>874</a>. The northwestern part of Kosovo, <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, became a part of the Byzantine <a href='Serb'>Serb</a> vassal state the <a href='Principality of Rascia'>Principality of Rascia</a>, with <a href='Desnik|Dostinik'>Desnik|Dostinik</a> as the principality's capital.</p>
<p>In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire</a>. Although <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> restored control over <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> throughout the 10th century, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire in a period of Bulgarian decline. However, Tsar <a href='Samuil of Bulgaria'>Samuil of Bulgaria</a> reconquered the whole of Kosovo in the late 10th century until the Byzantines restored their control over the area as they subjugated the Bulgarian Empire. In 1040-1041, Bulgarians, led by the Samuil of Bulgaria's grandson Petar Delyan staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantine control over the region continued.</p>
<p> 
Throughout the following decades, numerous foreign peoples invading the Byzantine Empire stormed Kosovo, among them the <a href='Cumans'>Cumans</a>.</p>
<p> 
In 1072, local Bulgarians, under George Voiteh, pushed a final attempt to restore Imperial Bulgarian power and invited the last heir of the <a href='House of Comitopuli'>House of Comitopuli</a> - <a href='Duklja'>Duklja</a>'s prince <a href='Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin'>Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin</a> of the <a href='House of Vojislavljevic'>House of Vojislavljevic</a>, son of the <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Mihailo Voislav'>Mihailo Voislav</a> - to assume power. The Serbs decided to conquer the entire Byzantine region of Bulgaria. King Mihailo dispatched his son with 300 elite Serb fighters led by Duke Petrilo. Constantine Bodin was crowned in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> as <em>Petar III</em>, <a href='List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians'>List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians</a> by Goerge Voiteh and the Slavic Boyars. The Empire swept across Byzantine territories in months, until the significant losses on the south had forced Czar Petar to withdraw. In 1073, the Byzantine forces chased Constantine Bodin, defeated his army at <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a>, and imprisoned him.</p>
<a name="Incorporation_into_Serbia"></a><h4>Incorporation into Serbia</h4><p>The full Serbian takeover was carried out under a branch of the <a href='House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav'>House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav</a> <a href='Grand Prince'>Grand Princes</a> of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a>. In <a href='1093'>1093</a>, Prince Vukan advanced on <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The Byzantine Emperor himself came to <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a> for negotiations. ZveÄan served as the Byzantine line-of-defence against constant invasions from the neighboring Serbs. A peace agreement was made, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. Vukan's armies stormed Kosovo. In <a href='1094'>1094</a>, <a href='Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius'>Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius</a> attempted to renew peace negotiations in Ulpiana. A new peace agreement was concluded and Vukan handed over hostages to the Emperor, including his two nephews UroÅ¡ and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the conflict in <a href='1106'>1106</a>, once again defeating John Comnenus' army. However, his death halted the total Serb conquest of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In <a href='1166'>1166</a>, a Serbian nobleman from <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a>, <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>Stefan Nemanja</a>, the founder of the <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja</a> ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a>. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the <a href='Sitnica'>Sitnica</a> river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in <a href='1183'>1183</a>, Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the <a href='Hungarians'>Hungarians</a> after the death of <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a> in <a href='1180'>1180</a>, marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Nemanja's son, <a href='Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II'>Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II</a>, recorded that the border of the Serbian realm reached the river of Lab. Grand Prince Stephen II completed the inclusion of the Kosovo territories under Serb rule in 1208, by which time he had conquered Prizren and Lipljan, and moved the border of territory under his control to the Å ar mountain.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_the_Serbs"></a><h4>Kingdom of the Serbs</h4><p>In <a href='1217'>1217</a>, the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom'>History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom</a> achieved recognition. In <a href='1219'>1219</a>, an autocephalous <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was created, with <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, Prizren and Lipljan being the Orthodox Christian <a href='Episcopates'>Episcopates</a> on Kosovo. By the end of the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, the centre of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church</a> was moved to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> from <a href='Å½iÄa'>Å½iÄa</a>.</p>
<p>In the 13th century, Kosovo became the heart of the Serbian political and religious life, with the Å ar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was in Pauni. On an island was <a href='SvrÄin'>SvrÄin</a>, and on the coast <a href='Å timlji'>Å timlji</a>, and in the mountains was the Castle of <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating, and as the rulers' living quarters. After 1291, the Tartars broke all the way to PeÄ. <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a> managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the <a href='Mother of Christ'>Mother of Christ</a> of LjeviÅ¡ka in Prizren around 1307, which became the seat of the Prizren Episcopric, and the magnificent <a href='GraÄanica'>GraÄanica</a> in 1335, the seat of the Lipljan Episcopric. In 1331, Juvenille King DuÅ¡an attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in Nerodimlje. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of <a href='PetriÄ'>PetriÄ</a>, but DuÅ¡an captured him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palailogos and their children in ZveÄan, where the dethroned King died on <a href='11 November'>11 November</a> <a href='1331'>1331</a>.</p>
<p>In 1327 and 1328, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani started forming the vast DeÄani domain, although, Serbian King DuÅ¡an would finish it in 1335. Stefan of Dechani issued the Dechani Charter in 1330, listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne.</p>
<a name="Serbian_Empire_and_Despotate"></a><h4>Serbian Empire and Despotate</h4><p><a href='Monarch|King'>Monarch|King</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archaengel near Prizren in <a href='1342'>1342</a>-<a href='1352'>1352</a>. The Kingdom was transformed into an <a href='Serbian Empire|Empire'>Serbian Empire|Empire</a> in 1345 and officially in 1346. Stefan DuÅ¡an received <a href='John VI Cantacuzenus'>John VI Cantacuzenus</a> in <a href='1342'>1342</a> in his Castle in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In <a href='1346'>1346</a>, the Serbian <a href='Archbishopric|Archepiscopric'>Archbishopric|Archepiscopric</a> at PeÄ was upgraded into a <a href='Patriarchate'>Patriarchate</a>, but it was not recognized before <a href='1370'>1370</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the Empire fell into disarray prior to DuÅ¡an's death in <a href='1355'>1355</a>, feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar <a href='Stefan UroÅ¡ V'>Stefan UroÅ¡ V</a>. Kosovo became a domain of the <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ</a>, but Prince Voislav VoinoviÄ expanded his demesne further into Kosovo. The armies of King <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ</a> from <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a> and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in <a href='1369'>1369</a>, putting a halt to his advances. After the <a href='Battle of Marica'>Battle of Marica</a> on <a href='26 September'>26 September</a> <a href='1371'>1371</a>, in which the MrnjavÄeviÄ brothers lost their lives, <a href='House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ'>House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ</a> of <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a> took Prizren and PeÄ in <a href='1372'>1372</a>. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the <a href='Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ'>Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> invaded and met the Christian coalition of Serbs, Albanians and Vlahcs under <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> on <a href='28 June'>28 June</a> <a href='1389'>1389</a>, near <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a>, at Gazi Mestan. The Serbian Army was assisted by various allies. The epic <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the Ottomans had 140,000. Through the cunning of <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a>, <a href='Sultan'>Sultan</a> <a href='Murad I|Murad'>Murad I|Murad</a> was murdered and the new Sultan <a href='Beyazid'>Beyazid</a> had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> and <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> were canonised by the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> for their efforts in the battle. The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by the Albanian ruler Gjergj Kastrioti <a href='Skanderbeg'>Skanderbeg</a> on one side, and Ottoman troops supported by the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄs</a> in <a href='1448'>1448</a>. Skanderbeg's troops that were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the BrankoviÄ's troops, who was more or less a Turkish <a href='Vassal'>Vassal</a>. Hungarian King <a href='John Hunyadi'>John Hunyadi</a> lost the battle after a 2-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the Ottoman Empire, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in 1459.</p>
<p> 
In 1455, new castles rose to prominence in PriÅ¡tina and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, centres of the Ottoman vassalaged House of BrankoviÄ.</p>

{{main|Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire}}
The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> brought <a href='Islamisation'>Islamisation</a> with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the <a href='Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Kosovo'>Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Kosovo</a> as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. This brought a great shift, as the Orthodox Serb population began to lose its majority when large numbers of <a href='Turkic peoples|Turks'>Turkic peoples|Turks</a> and <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> moved to Kosovo. During the Islamisation, many Churches and Holy Orthodox Christian places were destroyed or turned into Mosques. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren was torn down at the end of the 16th century and the material used to build the Mosque of Sinan-pasha, an Islamized Serb, in Prizren. Although the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was officially abolished in 1532, an Islamized Serb from Bosnia, Vizier <a href='Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ'>Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ</a> influenced the restoration of the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> in 1557. Special privileges were provided, which helped the survival of Serbs and other Christians in Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the <a href='Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (1683â1699)|Great War of 1683-1699'>Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (1683â1699)|Great War of 1683-1699</a> with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a <a href='Catholic Archibishop'>Catholic Archibishop</a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion. In <a href='1690'>1690</a>, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III ÄarnojeviÄ'>Arsenije III ÄarnojeviÄ</a>, who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the Ottomans. The people that followed him were mostly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> â 20,000 Serbs abandoned <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> alone - but they were likely followed by other ethnic groups. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the <a href='18th century'>18th century</a>. It is also noted that some <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> adopted <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>, while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanians, adopting their culture and even language. By the end of the 19th century, <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> replaced the Serbs as the dominating nation of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of <a href='Christians'>Christians</a> in Kosovo was greatly reduced. All previous privileges were lost, and the Christian population had to suffer the full weight of the Empire's extensive and losing wars, even having blame forced upon them for the losses.</p>
<a name="Modern"></a><h3>Modern</h3><p>{{Copyedit|date=February 2007}}
In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory.</p>
<p>Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the <a href='1876'>1876</a>-<a href='1877'>1877</a> Serbo-Turkish war and the <a href='1877'>1877</a>-<a href='1878'>1878</a> Russo-Turkish war are now known as '<a href='muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher'>muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher</a>' (which means 'refugee', from <a href='Arabic'>Arabic</a> <a href='muhajir'>muhajir</a>). Their descendents still have the same surname, <em>Muhaxheri</em>. It is estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> between <a href='1876'>1876</a> and <a href='1912'>1912</a>, especially during the <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War'>Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War</a> in <a href='1897'>1897</a>.</p>
<p> 
In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of PriÅ¡tina and <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>Kosovska Mitrovica</a> under civil Serbian control,  and outside the juristiction of the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a response, the Albanians formed the nationalistic and conservative <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> later the same year. Over 300 Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>Greater Albania|unified Albanian people</a> under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure on the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army began fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1898 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.</p>
<p> 
In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decrete that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularely the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from PriÅ¡tina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However, at that time Serbs have consisted about 40% of the whole Vilayt of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo.</p>

The Albanians joined and supported the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a>. As opposed to Serbian schools, numerous Albanian schools were opened during the 'occupation' (the majority Albanian population considered it a liberation). Allied ships were awaiting for Serbian people and soldiers at the banks of the Adriatic sea and the path leading them there went across Kosovo and Albania. Tens of thousands of soldiers have died of starvation, extreme weather and Albanian reprisals as they were approaching the <a href='Allies'>Allies</a> in <a href='Corfu'>Corfu</a> and <a href='Thessaloniki'>Thessaloniki</a>, amassing a total of 100,000 dead retreaters.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Transported away from the front lines, Serbian army managed to heal many wounded and ill soldiers and get some rest. Refreshed and regrouped, it decided to return to the battlefield. In 1918 the Serbian Army pushed the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a> out of Kosovo. During their re-occupation of Kosovo, the Serbian Army committed atrocities against the population in revenge. Serbian Kosovo was unified with Montengrin as Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia. After the World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians'>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians</a> <em>("MbretÃ«ria Serbe, Kroate, Sllovene" in Albanian, " "Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca" in Serbo-Croatian)</em> on <strong><a href='1 December'>1 December</a> <a href='1918'>1918</a></strong>, gathering territories gained in victory.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_and_WWII"></a><h4>Kingdom of Yugoslavia and WWII</h4><p>The 1918-1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In the Kingdom Kosovo was split onto four counties - three being a part of the entity of Serbia: ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since <a href='26 April'>26 April</a> <a href='1922'>1922</a> split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>. In 1921 the Albanian elite lodged an official protest of the government to the League of Nations, claiming that 12,000 Albanians had been killed and over 22,000 imprisoned since 1918 and seeking a <a href='Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands'>Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands</a>. The League of Nations did not respond, as the appeal was found unfounded. As a result, an armed <em>Kachak</em> resistance movement was formed whose main goal was to unite Albanian-populated areas of the Kingdom to Albania.</p>

<p>Prior to the surrender of <a href='History of Italy|Fascist Italy'>History of Italy|Fascist Italy</a> in <a href='1943'>1943</a>, the German forces took over direct control of the region.

In the <a href='1974'>1974</a> constitution, the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. <a href='Serbo-Croatian'>Serbo-Croatian</a> and <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> were defined as official languages on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Albanians and Serbs. In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. The ethnic balance of Kosovo witnessed unproportional increase as the number of <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> tripled gradually rising from almost 65% to over 80%, but the number of <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> barely increased and dropped in the full share of the total population from some 25% down to 10%.</p>
<p>Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities"&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Serbs and Yugoslav state authorities resulting in increased emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="reuters19860527"&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csm19860728"&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.&lt;ref name="nyt19870627"&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In <a href='1986'>1986</a>, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a>, a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering of ethnic strives and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>6</a>.

<p>By the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and <a href='Vojvodina'>Vojvodina</a>.&lt;ref name="reuters19880730"&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a name="Kosovo_and_the_Breakup_of_Yugoslavia"></a><h4>Kosovo and the Breakup of Yugoslavia</h4><p>Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, complained about mistreatment from the Albanian majority.  Milosevic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.  In 1987, Serbian President Ivan Stambolic sent MiloÅ¡eviÄ to Kosovo to "pacify restive Serbs in Kosovo." On that trip, MiloÅ¡eviÄ broke away from a meeting with ethnic Albanians to mingle with angry Serbians in a suburb of Pristina. As the Serbs protested they were being pushed back by police with batons, MiloÅ¡eviÄ told them, "No one is allowed to beat you."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/kosovo/stories/past/milosevic/&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident was later seen as pivotal to Milosevic's rise to power.</p>
<p>On June 28, 1989, Milosevic delivered a speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a>. This speech was widely interpreted as being a pivotal moment in Milosevic's rise to power.</p>
<p>In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia.  Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a>, <a href='1990'>1990</a> an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations but was not recognized internationally. With an <em>80%</em> turnout, <em>98%</em> voted for Kosovo to be independent.</p>
<a name="Kosovo_War"></a><h4>Kosovo War</h4><p>{{main|Kosovo War}}</p>
<p>In 1995, as the issues that sparked wars in <a href='Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia'>Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia</a> and <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> were largely addressed in the Dayton peace agreement, the Kosovo situation remained without resolution.  As Kosovo Albanian complaints over Serb oppression mounted, an armed resistance movement led by the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA) began to employ guerilla-style tactics against Serbian security forces. Violence escalated dramatically in 1998 through a cycle of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals.  Both sides sometimes targeted civilians.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1998, as the violence worsened and displaced more people, representatives of the international community brokered a ceasefire.  Under an agreement negotiated by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, observers from the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
But the ceasefire did not hold and new violence erupted over the winter.  On January 16, 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanians were found in the village of <a href='Racak'>Racak</a>.  OSCE monitors alleged they were the victims of a massacre by Serb forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1812847.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The <a href='Racak incident'>Racak incident</a> in particular brought new international attention to the conflict in Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Within weeks, representatives of Russia, the European Union and the United States convened a conference in <a href='Rambouillet'>Rambouillet</a>, France, to seek a way to end the violence. A draft agreement was prepared (the "<a href='Rambouillet Accords'>Rambouillet Accords</a>") that would have resulted in a NATO peacekeeping force deployed to Kosovo and the establishment of meaningful autonomy in Kosovo; the agreement also would have led to an international conference in three years to resolve the issue of Kosovo's status.  After more than a month of talks, Yugoslavia refused to sign an agreement.  Kosovo Albanians, after initially rejecting the accords because they did not promise immediate independence, eventually agreed.</p>
<p>Largely as a result of the failure of the Raimbouillet conference, NATO launched a 78-day <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> aerial bombing campaign in the spring of <a href='1999'>1999</a> with the announced goal of compelling Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.  Milosevic capitulated in June 1999, agreeing to the full withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
During the conflict roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled Kosovo, several thousand were killed (the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed). An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict. Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a name="Kosovo_After_the_War"></a><h4>Kosovo After the War</h4><p>After the war ended, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1244 that placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (<a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a>) and authorized <a href='Kosovo Force|KFOR'>Kosovo Force|KFOR</a>, a NATO-led peacekeeping force.  Almost immediately returning Kosovo Albanians began to attack the remaining Kosovo Serbs, causing large numbers of Serbs and other non-Albanians to flee. The number of registered refugees is around 250,000&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20040203102745/http://www.serbia.sr.gov.yu/coordination_centre/index.html Coordination Centre of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Republic of Serbia for Kosovo and Metohija'>7</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a href='UNHCR'>UNHCR</a>: 2002 Annual Statistical Report: Serbia and Montenegro, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a href='U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants'>U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants</a>: <a href='http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=1624 Country report: Serbia and Montenegro 2006'>8</a>.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible that the actual number of refugees is far smaller; subsequent international studies have put the number at as few as 65,000. &lt;ref&gt;UNHCR, Critical Appraisal of Responsee Mechanisms Operating in Kosovo for Minority Returns, Pristina, February 2004, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=156&amp;document_ID=53'>9</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  Many displaced Serbs are afraid to return to their homes, even with <a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a> protection.  Around 120,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, but are subject to ongoing harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p>In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework or Kosovo that established the <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister.  Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year).  UNMIK oversaw the establishment of a professional, multi-ethnic Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>  
In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War.  The <a href='2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004'>2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004</a> was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots.

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted UNMIK with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states (e.g., foreign affairs).  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (e.g., Bosniak, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>
<p>  
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>.  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>10</a> ", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>11</a> ", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

{{current event}}</p>
<p>A UN-led political process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status.  Belgrade has proposed that Kosovo be highly autonomous and remain a part of Serbia â Belgrade officials have repeatedly said that an imposition of Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and therefore contrary to international law. Pristina asserts that Kosovo should become independent, arguing that the violence of the Milosevic years has made continued union between Kosovo and Serbia not viable.</p>

<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
