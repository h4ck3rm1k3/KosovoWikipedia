'''Kosovo''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosovë'' / ''Kosova'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Косово'') is a region in the central Balkans. It is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute between Serbia and the province's majority ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] population. Since the conclusion of the [[Kosovo War]], the region has been administered by the [[United Nations]] Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo ([[UNMIK]]). The province's final status has yet to be determined; talks on this issue began February 20, [[2006]].

== Geography ==

[[image:UTkosovo rel small 92.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Physical map of Kosovo]]

With an area of [[1 E10 m²|10,912]] [[square kilometre|km²]] (4,203 [[square mile|mi²]]) and a population of over two million on the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosovë borders [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Serbia]] to the North and East; [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the south, and [[Albania]] to the southwest. The largest cities are [[Prishtinë]]/[[Pristina]] the capital, with an estimated 500,000 inhabitants, and [[Prizren]] in the southwest with 120,000: five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000.


 Albanians, were latecomers to the region.

==Disputes over language, culture and citizenship==
The province is most widely known as 'Kosovo' and this has become the standard in international and United Nations usage. In [[Albanian language|Albanian]] this name becomes 'Kosova', which is more often found within Kosovo and in official use by the Provisional Institutions, though both Albanian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] are official languages. Wherever political and cultural sensitivity are particularly important, the international community will use 'Kosovo/Kosova' to describe the province and adopt a similar standard for many place names. While the formal title 'Republic of Kosova' has fallen out of use with the integration of Kosovo Albanian politics into the UNMIK system, the formal Serbian title 'Kosovo i Metohija' remains in colloquial and official use in parts of Kosovo and in Serbia proper, where parallel institutions for Kosovo remain until final status is resolved.

The question of what to call the inhabitants of Kosovo collectively has also aroused debate. The two words accepted by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] are &quot;Kosovar&quot; (borrowed from Albanian), the most widely used variant in English, by far, and &quot;Kosovan&quot; (using the English rules for [[demonym]]s) much less used. As Kosovo has no formal [[state]]hood, current international usage is to refer to Kosovo [[Serbs]] and Kosovo [[Albanians]]. Most of the Albanian-descended community in Kosovo would prefer the use of Kosovar or Kosovan because of the attendant political overtones, while the Serb minority continue to think of themselves as Serb or Serbian (from Kosovo).

As for language and citizenship, so for cultural and political symbols. The province has never had an official flag of its own. The [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]] is used unofficially by the Kosovo Albanian-dominated administration and the vast majority of Kosovo Albanians; although recently the [[:Image:Kosovo Presidential Flag.gif|flag of the presidency]] is being used as an unofficial flag of Kosovo, as could be seen during [[Ibrahim Rugova]]'s funeral [http://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Rugova].

The Serb-inhabited area of north Kosovo uses only the [[flag of Serbia]], which is formally the flag of Serbia, although this usage is rejected by virtually all Kosovo Albanians, Croats, Turks, Goranis and other smaller minorities apart from Serbs and some Roma.



== Economy ==

[[UNMIK]] declared the [[euro]] to be the official currency of the province in [[2001]] in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the [[Deutschmark]], which had become the ''de facto'' currency even before the 1999 war. However, the [[Serbian dinar]] remains an official currency, used principally in the [[Kosovo Serb enclaves]]; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro; Kosovo's administration uses the euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the [[United States dollar]] and [[Swiss franc]] are the most widespread.

== Demographics ==
Ethnic Albanians comprise almost 90% of the population of the province. In the aftermath of the conflict some six hundred thousand non-Albanians, particularly [[Serbs]], were forcibly expelled by the Albanian majority or fled the province to escape perceived threats of revenge by Albanians(note:Most of Kosovo Serbs were in the ruling administration of Milosevic's dictatorship in Kosovo). The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall since the arrival of NATO and the UN as a result of violence, perceived intimidation, and economic hardship. Many still live in communal camps in [[Serbia]] or [[Macedonia]]. However, there have been many attempts by Kosovo's government to resettle Non-Albanians in the region which have largely been successful( because of the constant reprisal they have been through ) , including the resettlement of well over one thousand Serbians and Roma from 2004 - 2005.  
According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo[http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf], Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1,8 and 2,0 million in the following ethnic proportions:
* 88% [[Albanians]] (between 1,584,000 and 1,733,600) 
* 7% [[Serbs]] (between 126,000 and 140,000)	
* 3% [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] and [[Bosniaks]] (54 to 60 thousand) 
* 2% [[Roma people|Roma]] (36 to 40 thousand) [[Roma in Mitrovica Camps]]
* 1% [[Turkish people|Turks]] (18 to 20 thousand)
However, the figures are highly disputable and may presently include an Albanian majority well above 90 percent.
