Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in[ <a href='1183'>]1183[<\/a>], Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the[ <a href='Hungarians'>]Hungarians[<\/a> ]after the death of[ <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>]Manuel I Comnenus[<\/a> ]in[ <a href='1180'>]1180[<\/a>], marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo..[][<\/p>

Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of[ <a href='1683'>]1683[<\/a> ]-[ <a href='1699'>]1699[<\/a> ]with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a[ <a href='Catholic Archibishop'>]Catholic Archibishop[<\/a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>]PjetÃ«r Bogdani[<\/a>].

The people that followed him were mostly[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]â 20,000 Serbs abandoned[ <a href='Prizren'>]Prizren[<\/a> ]alone - but they were likely followed by other ethnic groups. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the[ <a href='18th century'>]18th century[<\/a>]. It is also noted that some[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]adopted[ <a href='Islam'>]Islam[<\/a>], while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanianians, adopting their culture and even language..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the[ <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>]Patriarchate of PeÄ[<\/a> ]and the position of[ <a href='Christians'>]Christians[<\/a> ]in Kosovo was greatly reduced.

<a name="Modern"><\/a><h3>]Modern.[][<\/h3><p>]In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren. The possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed at the meeting, as the[ <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>]History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia[<\/a> ]itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory, much easier than elsewhere..[][<\/p>

It is also estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the[ <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>]Vilayet of Kosovo[<\/a> ]between[ <a href='1876'>]1876[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='1912'>]1912[<\/a>], especially during the[ <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War'>]Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War[<\/a> ]in[ <a href='1897'>]1897[<\/a>]..[][<\/p>

]In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that gave the cities of[ <a href='Prishtina'>]Prishtina[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Mitrovica'>]Mitrovica[<\/a> ]under civil Serbian control, outside the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a responce, the Albanians formed the nationalistic[ &amp; ]conservative[ <a href='League of Prizren'>]League of Prizren[<\/a> ]in[ <a href='Prizren'>]Prizren[<\/a> ]later the same year. Over 300 Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a[ <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>]Greater Albania|unified Albanian people[<\/a> ]under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1898 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well{{citation needed}}..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decrete that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularely the Albanians. In 1910, an[ <a href='Albanian'>]Albanian[<\/a> ]uprising spread from[ <a href='Prishtina'>]Prishtina[<\/a> ]and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However at that time Serbs have consisted about[ <em>]40%[<\/em> ]of the whole Vilayt of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo..[][<\/p>

An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia.

]After the[ <a href='Dayton'>]Dayton[<\/a> ]Agreement in 1995, some Albanians organized into the[ <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>]Kosovo Liberation Army[<\/a> ](KLA), employing guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and civilians. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims.

Under an agreement led by[ <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>]Richard Holbrooke[<\/a>],[ <a href='OSCE'>]OSCE[<\/a> ]observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of[ <a href='Racak'>]Racak[<\/a>].

After more than a month of negotations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has beeen argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation)..[][<\/p>
<p>]This triggered a 78-day[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a> ]campaign in[ <a href='1999'>]1999[<\/a>].

]During the conflict, several thousand were killed, the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed. An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict, including military personnel and civilians, primarily as a result of the ground war in Kosovo between the KLA and the Yugoslav military, Serbian police and Serbian paramilitary forces.
