<strong>Kosovo and Metohia</strong> (<a href='Serbian language|Serbian'>Serbian language|Serbian</a>: &amp;#1050;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1086; &amp;#1080; &amp;#1052;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1093;&amp;#1080;&amp;#1112;&amp;#1072;; <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a>: <em>Kosova</em>) or <strong>Kosovo</strong> is a region in the western <a href='Balkan Peninsula'>Balkan Peninsula</a> with an <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> population (estimated at 80% prior to the international conflict of 1999, but now somewhat larger owing to the fleeing of <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and other non-Albanians; see <a href='Kosovo population data-points'>Kosovo population data-points</a>). "Kosovo" is from "Kosovo Polje" which means "Blackbird's field" in <a href='Serbian language'>Serbian language</a>.  "Metohia" is a Greek word which denotes church-owned land.</p>
<p>Its international status is anomalous in that although it is formally a province of the Republic of <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a>, actual administration is presently conducted by the <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> with no involvement on the part of the Serbian governments (under Security Council resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999; see <a href='http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/1999/sc99.htm Security Council Resolutions 1999'>1</a>). A <a href='parliament'>parliament</a> was elected in November <a href='2001'>2001</a> and <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> was selected as president in March <a href='2002'>2002</a>, however the UN retained control of security, justice and external affairs.</p>
<p>Despite the International Community's official use of the <a href='Euro'>Euro</a>, the  <a href='Serbian dinar'>Serbian dinar</a> is very widespread in Kosovo because most trade is done with the rest of Serbia. The <a href='Kosovo Serb enclaves'>Kosovo Serb enclaves</a> also use the <a href='Serbian dinar'>Serbian dinar</a> widely. Other international currencies (<a href='Dollar'>Dollar</a>, <a href='Swiss Franc'>Swiss Franc</a>) are also widespread. Most Albanians are now, after years of boycotting the Serb state, waiting in lines to acquire Serbo-Montenegrin passports in order to travel abroad.</p>
<p>With an area of <a href='1 E10 m2|10,887'>1 E10 m2|10,887</a> <a href='square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'>square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;</a> and a population of almost 2 million on the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosovo borders with <a href='Montenegro'>Montenegro</a> to the northwest, rest of <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> to the north and east, the <a href='Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'>Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</a> to the south and <a href='Albania'>Albania</a> to the southwest. The largest cities are <a href='Prishtina|Pri&amp;#353;tina'>Prishtina|Pri&amp;#353;tina</a>, the capital, with 190,000 inhabitants, and <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> in the southwest with 120,000: five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000.</p>
<p>Kosovo's anomalous status is the result of the <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a> of March-June <a href='1999'>1999</a>, in the course of which air strikes against the <a href='Yugoslavia|Federal republic of Yugoslavia'>Yugoslavia|Federal republic of Yugoslavia</a>'s armed forces and infrastructure, by members of the <a href='North Atlantic Treaty Organization'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> forced the signing of the <a href='Kumanovo agreement'>Kumanovo agreement</a> which provided for the withdrawal of military and the province's occupation by a NATO-led international force (KFOR) including also <a href='Russia'>Russian</a> troops (no longer serving as of July <a href='2003'>2003</a>).</p>
<p>Entered by Serbs migrating from the north-east around the early 7th century AD, Kosovo was a centre of the medieval Serbian kingdom until its conquest by the <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks</a> in the late 14th century. The existing Albanian population is greatly formed by migrants from the south-west (modern <a href='Albania'>Albania</a>) during the centuries of Ottoman rule (particularly during and after the 17th century), when Islam also became the faith of most of the Albanian people.</p>
<p>From the <a href='1870s'>1870s</a> onwards Albanians in the region formed the <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> to resist Ottoman rule, and a provisional government was formed in <a href='1881'>1881</a>. In <a href='1912'>1912</a> Kosovo was briefly included in the newly independent state of <a href='Albania'>Albania</a>. But the following year the Great Powers (Britain, America, France etc) forced Albania to cede the region to <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a>. In <a href='1918'>1918</a> Kosovo became a part of the newly formed <a href='Yugoslavia'>Yugoslavia</a>.</p>
<p> 
Between 1941 and 1945 Kosovo was included under the Italian-occupied <a href='Greater Albania'>Greater Albania</a>. Following the end of the war and the establishment of <a href='Tito'>Tito</a>'s <a href='Communist'>Communist</a> regime. Kosovo was given the status of an autonomous region of Serbia in 1946 and an autonomous province in 1963. Kosovo enjoyed almost complete self-government under predominantly Albanian local communist party leaders from 1974 until 1989, when its autonomy was revoked by <a href='Slobodan Milosevic'>Slobodan Milosevic</a> who implemented a new, Serbian constitution.</p>
<p>Kosovo was placed province under de facto military occupation. Kosovo's parliament was suspended in <a href='1990'>1990</a>. Albanian media was suppressed, and all Albanian-language education was suspended (although elementary education was restored in late 1994). Albanians were also fired en-mass from state owned industries.</p>
<p>Kosovar Albanians were outraged by these developments, illegal elections in 1992, which overwhelmingly elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as "president" were declared illegal by the Serbian government. In <a href='1995'>1995</a> thousands of Serbs displaced from <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> were settled in Kosovo, which further worsened relations between the two communities.</p>
<p>Albanian opposition to sovereignty of Yugoslavia and especially Serbia, which had surfaced in rioting (1968 and March 1981) in the capital <a href='Prishtina|Pri&amp;#353;tina'>Prishtina|Pri&amp;#353;tina</a>, subsequently took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the "<a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a>" (<em>Ushtria Ãlirimtare e KosovÃ«s</em>, or UÃK). The KLA repeatedly atacked Serbian police. In March 1998 a major Serbian crackdown began in Kosova, with Yugoslav army units joining Serbian police to fight the ethnic Albanian separatists. In the months that followed, hundreds of people were killed and more than 200,000 were driven from their homes, most of these people were ethnic Albanians. The Serbian police and UÃK actions by 1998 created a state of low intensity warfare with some 2000 dying prior to <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a> of <a href='1999'>1999</a></p>
<p>The <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> estimated that during the Kosovo War, nearly 640,000 Albanians fled from Serb atrocities and fighting in Kosovo between March 1998 and the end of April 1999. Most of the refugees went to <a href='Albania'>Albania</a>, the <a href='Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'>Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</a>, or <a href='Montenegro'>Montenegro</a>.</p>
<p><a href='Slobodan Milosevic'>Slobodan Milosevic</a> and other senior Serb officials were indicted by the United Nations for <a href='war crime'>war crimes</a> commited by Serb forces in Kosovo.</p>

Both <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> and the <a href='United Nations|UN'>United Nations|UN</a> continue to recognise Kosovo as a part of Serbia, but with the departure since 1999 of much of the Serb population and the reluctance of local Albanians to see Serbian sovereignty restored in practice, it is difficult to imagine how the removal of de facto Serbian authority in the province can be reconciled with assurances of Serbia's continued territorial integrity given by the NATO powers and reaffirmed (June 1999) in UN Security Council resolution 1244.</p>
<p> 
At the same time, it is also difficult to see how <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> would consent to recognizing independence of Kosovo, and without Serbia's approval, recognition of Kosovo independence would be extremely problematic under <a href='international law'>international law</a> as it would be a violation of the principles of <a href='territorial integrity'>territorial integrity</a> and <a href='non-interference in internal affairs'>non-interference in internal affairs</a>. The most likely outcome is the indefinite continuation of the current situation.</p>
