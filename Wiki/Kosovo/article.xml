[[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosovë'' / ''Kosova'' / ''Dardania'')]]. It is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute between Serbia and the majority ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] population. Since the [[Kosovo War]] it has been administered by the [[United Nations]] under the auspices of [[UNMIK]]. The province's final status has yet to be determined; talks on this issue are scheduled for later in [[2006]].

'''== Geography =='''

[[image:UTkosovo rel small 92.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Physical map of Kosovo]]

With an area of [[1 E10 m²|10,887]] [[square kilometre|km²]] and a population of over two million on the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosova borders [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, with the districts of [[Raška]], [[Toplica District|Toplica]], [[Jablanica]] and [[Pčinja District|Pčinja]] in [[Central Serbia]] to the North and East; [[FYROM]] to the south, and [[Albania]] to the southwest. The largest cities are [[Prishtina]] the capital, with estimated 500,000 inhabitants, and [[Prizren]] in the southwest with 120,000: five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000.

'''== History =='''

''See [[History of Kosovo]].''

==Disputes over language, culture and citizenship==

The province is most widely known as 'Kosova' and this has become the standard in international and United Nations usage. 

As for language and citizenship, so for cultural and political symbols. The province has never had an official flag of its own. The [[Flag of Albania|Albanian flag]] is used unofficially by the Albanian-dominated administration and the vast majority of Albanians. The Serb-inhabited area of north Kosova uses only the [[flag of Serbia]], which is formally the flag of Serbia, although this usage is rejected by virtually all Kosovo Albanians.

== Politics and international status ==
{{Politics of Kosovo}}
Kosova's international status is anomalous in that although it is a Serbian province within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, administration is presently conducted by the [[United Nations]] with little or no involvement on the part of the Serbia  government (under Security Council resolution 1244 of [[10 June]] [[1999]]; see [http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/1999/sc99.htm Security Council Resolutions 1999]).  The government of the province is the responsibility of the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK). Under the terms of the [[Kumanovo agreement]] and subsequent UN [[Security Council]] [[Resolution 1244]], which ended the [[Kosova War]], security is provided by the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which is led by [[NATO]] and is answerable to UNMIK.

UNMIK has so far established a provisional assembly, provisional government and the office of provisional president, which are legislative and executive bodies under UNMIK's control. Control of security, justice and external affairs are still under full UNMIK control. Elections for the [[Assembly of Kosova]] were held in November [[2001]] and again in [[2004]]. [[Ibrahim Rugova]] was elected as president in March [[2002]]. The seat of the assembly, government and president is in [[Prishtina]]. So far, the parliament has enacted and UNMIK approved a constitutional framework, customs code, and two criminal codes.

The Constitutional Framework enacted by the Kosova assembly (with UN Security Council approval) has adopted a policy of [[affirmative action]] in the assembly to ensure that the province's minorities are properly represented. Out of 120 seats, 10 are reserved for Serbs and another 10 for non-Albanian minorities. The process of 'returns' of these displaced persons has yet to begin in earnest, as a result of insufficient funding and a perceived inability of the UN to control violence against minority groups, as well as a concern on the part of Albanians that an increased proportion of Serbs will undermine the chances for an independent Kosova.

Kosova's final status has not yet been resolved, though talks on the subject are planned for 2006, and considerable difficulties lie ahead in reconciling the irreconcilable Kosova Albanian and Belgrade positions. The Kosova Albanians reject Serbian sovereignty and demand secession from the country. On the other side, Serbia is opposed to yielding any of its territory and domestic opinion continues to see the province as the heartland of Serbian culture.

UNMIK is issuing travel documents which serve instead of [[passport]]s in countries which recognise them, and issues identity cards and car plates, which again are valid only in certain countries. UNMIK has created a police force (the [[Kosova Police Service]]) with employees from all ethnic communities (Albanian, Turkish, Serbian, Roma, Bosniac, etc) and manages the province's railways and airline ([[Kosova Airlines]]). The airspace of the province is controlled by KFOR.

'''== Economy =='''

[[UNMIK]] declared the [[euro]] to be official currency of the province in [[2001]] in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the [[Deutschmark]], which had become ''de facto'' currency even before the 1999 war. However, the [[Serbian dinar]] remains an official currency, though used principally in the [[Kosova Serb enclaves]]; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro, Kosova's administration uses euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the [[United States dollar]] and [[Swiss franc]] are the most widespread.

== Demographics ==

Albanians now comprise almost 90% of the population of the country, a percentage which has increased over time as a result of a high birth rate. Though mass emigration of Albanians during the Kosova crisis was a deciding factor in NATO intervention, the United Nations has succeeded in resettling and rehousing all displaced Albanians. In the aftermath of the conflict several hundred thousand non-Albanians, particularly [[Serbs]], [[Janjevci|Janjevs]], and [[Roma (people)|Roma]], fled the province to escape renewed intercommunal violence. The non-Albanian population of Kosova has continued to fall in since the arrival of NATO and the UN as a result of intimidation and economic hardship. Many still live in communal camps in Serbia proper, cared for by international relief agencies.

According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosova[http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf], Kosova's total population is approximately 1,970,000 inthe following ethnic proportions:
* 88% [[Albanians]] (1,733,600) 
* 7% [[Serbs]] (173,900) 
* 3% [[Bosniaks]] (59,100) 
* 2% [[Roma|Romas]] (39,400) 
* 1% [[Turks]] (19,700)
Intercommunal violence has further reduced the number of non-Albanians in Kosovo since this survey, and many of those who do remain now live in heavily guarded villages.
