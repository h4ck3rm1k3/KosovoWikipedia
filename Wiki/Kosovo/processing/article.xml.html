{{see also|Demographic history of Kosovo}}</p>
<p>The region of Kosovo has been inhabited by <a href='Illyrians|Illyrian tribes'>Illyrians|Illyrian tribes</a> since the <a href='Bronze Age'>Bronze Age</a>. In ancient times, the area was known as <a href='Dardania (Europe)|Dardania'>Dardania (Europe)|Dardania</a> and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The south of Kosovo was ruled by <a href='Macedon'>Macedonia</a> since <a href='Alexander the Great'>Alexander the Great</a>'s reign in the 4th century BC. The local <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a> were of <a href='Illyrian'>Illyrian</a> stock. Illyrians resisted rule by the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading imperial powers, the region was eventually occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a> in 28 BC and became part of the Roman province of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a>. After <a href='85|AD 85'>85|AD 85</a> it was part of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a> Superior. Emperor <a href='Diocletian'>Diocletian</a> later c. <a href='284'>284</a> made Dardania into separate province with its capital at Naissus (<a href='NiÅ¡'>NiÅ¡</a>). Illyrians were among the first people to accept Christianity as they were evangelized by St. Paul himself. Illyria is twice mentioned in the Bible. When the Roman Empire split in <a href='Anno Domini|A.D.'>Anno Domini|A.D.</a> <a href='395'>395</a>, the area of Kosovo came under the <a href='Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire'>Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire</a>, the <a href='Byzantine Empire'>Byzantine Empire</a>.

<a name="Great_migrations_and_interregnums"></a><h4>Great migrations and interregnums</h4><p><a href='Slavic people|Slavs'>Slavic people|Slavs</a> came to the territories that form modern Kosovo in the <a href='7th century|seventh-century'>7th century|seventh-century</a> migrations of <a href='White Serbs'>White Serbs</a>, with the largest influx of migrants in the 630s; although the region was increasingly populated by Slavs since the sixth or even fifth century. These Slavs were <a href='Christianization|Christianized'>Christianization|Christianized</a> in several waves between the <a href='7th century|seventh'>7th century|seventh</a> and <a href='9th century|ninth century'>9th century|ninth century</a>, with the last wave taking place between <a href='867'>867</a> and <a href='874'>874</a>. The northwestern part of Kosovo, <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, became a part of the Byzantine <a href='Serb'>Serb</a> vassal state the <a href='Principality of Rascia'>Principality of Rascia</a>, with <a href='Desnik|Dostinik'>Desnik|Dostinik</a> as the principality's capital.</p>
<p>In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire</a>. Although <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> restored control over <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> throughout the <a href='10th century|tenth century'>10th century|tenth century</a>, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire in a period of Bulgarian decline. However, Tsar <a href='Samuil of Bulgaria'>Samuil of Bulgaria</a> reconquered the whole of Kosovo in the late tenth century until the Byzantines restored their control over the area as they subjugated the Bulgarian Empire. In 1040-1041, Bulgarians, led by the Samuil of Bulgaria's grandson Petar Delyan staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantine control over the region continued.</p>
<p> 
In 1072, local Bulgarians, under George Voiteh, pushed a final attempt to restore Imperial Bulgarian power and invited the last heir of the <a href='House of Comitopuli'>House of Comitopuli</a> - <a href='Duklja'>Duklja</a>'s prince <a href='Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin'>Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin</a> of the <a href='House of Vojislavljevic'>House of Vojislavljevic</a>, son of the <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Mihailo Voislav'>Mihailo Voislav</a> - to assume power. The Serbs decided to conquer the entire Byzantine region of Bulgaria. King Mihailo dispatched his son with three hundred elite Serb fighters led by Duke Petrilo. Constantine Bodin was crowned in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> as <em>Petar III</em>, <a href='List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians'>List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians</a> by George Voiteh and the Slavic Boyars. The Empire swept across Byzantine territories in months, until the significant losses on the south had forced Czar Petar to withdraw. In 1073, the Byzantine forces chased Constantine Bodin, defeated his army at <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a>, and imprisoned him.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 14th century the Serbian Empire fell into feudal anarchy on the death of <a href='Tsar'>Tsar</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> and local fiefdoms rose to power and prominence in their respective lands, with Kosovo becoming a Lordship under the <a href='BrankoviÄ'>BrankoviÄ</a> dynasty. The Ottoman Emirate took the opportunity to exploit Serbian weakness and invaded, with the <a href='Battle of Kossovo'>Battle of Kossovo</a> occurring in <a href='1389'>1389</a>. In <a href='1455'>1455</a>, the Ottoman Empire conquered Kosovo from Serbia.</p>
<a name="Incorporation_into_Serbia"></a><h4>Incorporation into Serbia</h4><p>The full Serbian takeover was carried out under a branch of the <a href='House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav'>House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav</a> <a href='Grand Prince'>Grand Princes</a> of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a>. In <a href='1093'>1093</a>, Prince Vukan advanced on <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The Byzantine Emperor himself came to <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a> for negotiations. ZveÄan served as the Byzantine line-of-defence against constant invasions from the neighboring Serbs. A peace agreement was made, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. Vukan's armies stormed Kosovo. In <a href='1094'>1094</a>, <a href='Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius'>Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius</a> attempted to renew peace negotiations in Ulpiana. A new peace agreement was concluded and Vukan handed over hostages to the Emperor, including his two nephews UroÅ¡ and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the conflict in <a href='1106'>1106</a>, once again defeating John Comnenus's army. However, his death halted the total Serb conquest of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In <a href='1166'>1166</a>, a Serbian nobleman from <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a>, <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>Stefan Nemanja</a>, the founder of the <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja</a> ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a>. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the <a href='Sitnica'>Sitnica</a> river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in <a href='1183'>1183</a>, Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the <a href='Hungarians'>Hungarians</a> after the death of <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a> in <a href='1180'>1180</a>, marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Nemanja's son, <a href='Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II'>Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II</a>, recorded that the border of the Serbian realm reached the river of Lab. Grand Prince Stephen II completed the inclusion of the Kosovo territories under Serb rule in 1208, by which time he had conquered Prizren and Lipljan, and moved the border of territory under his control to the Å ar mountain.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_the_Serbs"></a><h4>Kingdom of the Serbs</h4><p>In <a href='1217'>1217</a>, the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom'>History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom</a> achieved recognition. In <a href='1219'>1219</a>, an autocephalous <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was created, with <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, Prizren and Lipljan being the Orthodox Christian <a href='Episcopates'>Episcopates</a> on Kosovo. By the end of the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, the centre of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church</a> was moved to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> from <a href='Å½iÄa'>Å½iÄa</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href='13th century|thirteenth century'>13th century|thirteenth century</a>, Kosovo became the heart of the Serbian political and religious life, with the Å ar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was in Pauni. On an island was <a href='SvrÄin'>SvrÄin</a>, and on the coast <a href='Å timlji'>Å timlji</a>, and in the mountains was the Castle of <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating, and as the rulers' living quarters. After 1291, the Tartars broke all the way to PeÄ. <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a> managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the <a href='Mother of Christ'>Mother of Christ</a> of LjeviÅ¡ka in Prizren around 1307, which became the seat of the Prizren Bishopric, and the magnificent <a href='GraÄanica monastery'>GraÄanica monastery</a> in 1335, the seat of the Lipljan Bishopric. In 1331, the juvenile King DuÅ¡an attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in Nerodimlje. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of <a href='PetriÄ'>PetriÄ</a>, but DuÅ¡an captured him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palaiologos and their children in ZveÄan, where the dethroned King died on <a href='11 November'>11 November</a> <a href='1331'>1331</a>.</p>
<p>In 1327 and 1328, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani started forming the vast DeÄani domain, although, Serbian King DuÅ¡an would finish it in 1335. Stefan of Dechani issued the Dechani Charter in 1330, listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne.</p>
<a name="Serbian_Empire_and_Despotate"></a><h4>Serbian Empire and Despotate</h4><p><a href='Monarch|King'>Monarch|King</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren in <a href='1342'>1342</a>â<a href='1352'>1352</a>. The Kingdom was transformed into an <a href='Serbian Empire|Empire'>Serbian Empire|Empire</a> in 1345 and officially in 1346. Stefan DuÅ¡an received <a href='John VI Cantacuzenus'>John VI Cantacuzenus</a> in <a href='1342'>1342</a> in his Castle in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In <a href='1346'>1346</a>, the Serbian <a href='Archbishopric|Archepiscopric'>Archbishopric|Archepiscopric</a> at PeÄ was upgraded into a <a href='Patriarchate'>Patriarchate</a>, but it was not recognized before <a href='1370'>1370</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the Empire fell into disarray prior to DuÅ¡an's death in <a href='1355'>1355</a>, feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar <a href='Stefan UroÅ¡ V'>Stefan UroÅ¡ V</a>. Kosovo became a domain of the <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ</a>, but Prince Voislav VoinoviÄ expanded his demesne further into Kosovo. The armies of King <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ</a> from <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a> and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in <a href='1369'>1369</a>, putting a halt to his advances. After the <a href='Battle of Marica'>Battle of Marica</a> on <a href='26 September'>26 September</a> <a href='1371'>1371</a>, in which the MrnjavÄeviÄ brothers lost their lives, <a href='House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ'>House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ</a> of <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a> took Prizren and PeÄ in <a href='1372'>1372</a>. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the <a href='Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ'>Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> invaded and met the Serbian Army under <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> on <a href='28 June'>28 June</a> <a href='1389'>1389</a>, near <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a>, at Gazi Mestan. The Serbian Army was assisted by various allies. The epic <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the Ottomans had 140,000. Through the cunning of <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a>, <a href='Sultan'>Sultan</a> <a href='Murad I|Murad'>Murad I|Murad</a> was murdered and the new Sultan <a href='Beyazid'>Beyazid</a> had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> and <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> were canonized by the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> for their efforts in the battle. The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by the Albanian ruler Gjergj Kastrioti <a href='Skanderbeg'>Skanderbeg</a> on one side, and Ottoman troops supported by the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄs</a> in <a href='1448'>1448</a>. Skanderbeg's troops that were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the BrankoviÄ's troops, who was more or less a Turkish <a href='Vassal'>Vassal</a>. Hungarian King <a href='John Hunyadi'>John Hunyadi</a> lost the battle after a two-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the Ottoman Empire, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in 1459.</p>
<p> 
In 1455, new castles rose to prominence in PriÅ¡tina and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, centres of the Ottoman vassalaged House of BrankoviÄ.</p>

The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> brought <a href='Islamisation'>Islamisation</a> with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of <a href='1683'>1683</a>&amp;ndash;<a href='1699'>1699</a> with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a <a href='Catholic'>Catholic</a> <a href='Archbishop'>Archbishop</a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion. In <a href='1690'>1690</a>, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a>, who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the Ottomans. The people that followed him were mostly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> abandonedâbut they were likely followed by other ethnic groups. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the <a href='18th century'>18th century</a>. It is also noted that some <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> adopted <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>, while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanians, adopting their culture and even language.</p>
<p> 
In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of <a href='Christians'>Christians</a> in Kosovo was greatly reduced. All previous privileges were lost, and the Christian population had to suffer the full weight of the Empire's extensive and losing wars, even having blame forced upon them for the losses. The main reason for the convertion of Orthodox Albanians into Muslim Albanians was for the greater benefit of less taxes. Remnants of Orthodox Albanians, in Kosovo, went to live in mountains or in parts of Montenegro.</p>

In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory.</p>
<p>Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the <a href='1876'>1876</a>â<a href='1877'>1877</a> Serbo-Turkish war and the <a href='1877'>1877</a>â<a href='1878'>1878</a> Russo-Turkish war are now known as '<a href='muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher'>muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher</a>' (which means 'refugee', from <a href='Arabic'>Arabic</a> <a href='muhajir'>muhajir</a>). Their descendants still have the same surname, <em>Muhaxheri</em>. It is estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> between <a href='1876'>1876</a> and <a href='1912'>1912</a>, especially during the <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War'>Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War</a> in <a href='1897'>1897</a>.</p>
<p> 
In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of PriÅ¡tina and <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>Kosovska Mitrovica</a> under civil Serbian control,  and outside the juristiction of the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a response, the Albanians formed the nationalistic and conservative <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> later the same year. Over three hundred Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>Greater Albania|unified Albanian people</a> under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure on the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army began fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well. By the end of the 19th century the <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> replaced the <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> as the dominant people in Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decrete that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularely the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from PriÅ¡tina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However, at that time Serbs have consisted about 25% of the whole Vilayet of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian rule along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo.</p>

<p>In <a href='1912'>1912</a>, during the <a href='Balkan Wars'>Balkan Wars</a>, most of Kosovo was taken by the <a href='History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia</a>, while the region of <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> (<a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a>: <em>Dukagjini Valley</em>) was taken by the <a href='History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro'>History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro</a>. An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. This is best described by <a href='Leon Trotsky'>Leon Trotsky</a>, who was a reporter for the <em>Pravda</em> newspaper at the time. The Serbian authorities planned a recolonization of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt; <a href='http://www.elsie.de/pdf/B2002GatheringClouds.pdf Elsie, R. (ed.) (2002): "<em>Gathering Clouds.

ISBN 9951-05-016-6&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous colonist Serb families moved-in to Kosovo, equalizing the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs. Many Albanians fled into the mountains and numerous Albanian and Turkish houses were razed. The reconquest of Kosovo was noted as a vengeance for the 1389 <a href='Battle of Kossovo'>Battle of Kossovo</a>. At the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1912 presided over by Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, the Kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro were acknowledged sovereignty over Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
In the winter of <a href='1915'>1915</a>&amp;ndash;<a href='1916'>1916</a>, during <a href='World War I'>World War I</a>, Kosovo saw a large exodus of Serbian army which became known as the <em>Great Serbian Retreat</em>. Defeated and worn out in battles against Austro-Hungarians, they had no other choice than to retreat, as Kosovo was occupied by <a href='Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians'>Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians</a> and <a href='Austro-Hungarians'>Austro-Hungarians</a>. The Albanians joined and supported the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a>. As opposed to Serbian schools, numerous Albanian schools were opened during the 'occupation' (the majority Albanian population considered it a liberation). Allied ships were awaiting for Serbian people and soldiers at the banks of the Adriatic sea and the path leading them there went across Kosovo and Albania. Tens of thousands of soldiers have died of starvation, extreme weather and Albanian reprisals as they were approaching the <a href='Allies'>Allies</a> in <a href='Corfu'>Corfu</a> and <a href='Thessaloniki'>Thessaloniki</a>, amassing a total of 100,000 dead retreaters. Transported away from the front lines, Serbian army managed to heal many wounded and ill soldiers and get some rest. Refreshed and regrouped, it decided to return to the battlefield. In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a> out of Kosovo. During liberation of Kosovo, the Serbian Army committed atrocities against the population in revenge. Serbian Kosovo was unified with Montenegrin Metohija as Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia. After the World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians'>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians</a> (Albanian: <em>MbretÃ«ria Serbe, Kroate, Sllovene</em>, Serbo-Croatian: <em>Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca</em>) on <a href='1 December'>1 December</a> <a href='1918'>1918</a>, gathering territories gained in victory.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_and_World_War_II"></a><h4>Kingdom of Yugoslavia and World War II</h4><p>The 1918&amp;ndash;1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a raise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In the Kingdom Kosovo was split onto four countiesâthree being a part of the entity of Serbia: ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since <a href='26 April'>26 April</a> <a href='1922'>1922</a> split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>. In 1921 the Albanian elite lodged an official protest of the government to the League of Nations, claiming that 12,000 Albanians had been killed and over 22,000 imprisoned since 1918 and seeking a <a href='Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands'>Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands</a>. As a result, an armed <em>Kachak</em> resistance movement was formed whose main goal was to unite Albanian-populated areas of the Kingdom to Albania.</p>

In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Yugoslavia'>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>.

<p>Prior to the surrender of <a href='History of Italy|Fascist Italy'>History of Italy|Fascist Italy</a> in <a href='1943'>1943</a>, the German forces took over direct control of the region.

The province was first formed in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area to protect its regional <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> majority within the <a href='History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia'>History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia</a> as a member of the <a href='SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia'>SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia</a> under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, <a href='Josip Broz Tito'>Josip Broz Tito</a>, but with no factual autonomy. After Yugoslavia's name change to the <a href='Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> and Serbia's to the <a href='History of Serbia|Socialist Republic of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Socialist Republic of Serbia</a> in <a href='1953'>1953</a>, Kosovo gained inner autonomy in the 1960s. In the <a href='1974'>1974</a> constitution, the <a href='Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo'>Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo</a>'s government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Tito had pursued a policy of weakening Serbia, as he believed that a "Weak Serbia equals a strong Yugoslavia". To this end Vojvodina and Kosovo became autonomous regions and were given the above entitled privileges as defacto republics. <a href='Serbo-Croatian'>Serbo-Croatian</a>, <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> and <a href='Turkish language|Turkish'>Turkish language|Turkish</a> were defined as official languages on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Albanians and Serbs. In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. The ethnic balance of Kosovo witnessed unproportional increase as the number of <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> tripled gradually rising from almost 75% to over 90%, but the number of <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> barely increased and dropped in the full share of the total population from some 15% down to 8%. Even though Kosovo was the least developed area of the former Yugoslavia, the living and economic prospects and freedoms were far greater then under the totalitarian Maoist regieme in Albania.</p>
<p>Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities"&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Serbs and Yugoslav state authorities resulting in increased emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="reuters19860527"&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csm19860728"&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.&lt;ref name="nyt19870627"&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In <a href='1986'>1986</a>, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a>, a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>3</a>. GIP Kultura. Belgrade.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some think that <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> used the discontent reflected in the SANU memorandum for his own political goals, during his rise to power in <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/articles/ViewPopUpArticle.jsp?id=2&amp;articleId=3361 Julie A Mertus: "Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ: Myth and Responsibility"&lt;/ref&gt;,</p>
<p>  
MiloÅ¡eviÄ was initially sent there as a member of the Communists party . Initially MiloÅ¡eviÄ did not talk to the Serbian nationalists who were at that point demonstrating for rights and freedoms that had been denied to them. During these meetings he agreed to listen to their grievances. During the meeting, outside the building where this forum was taking place police started fighting the locals who had gathered there, mostly Serbs eager to voice their grievances. After hearing about the police brutality outside of the halls, MiloÅ¡eviÄ came out and in an emotional moment promised the local Serbs that "No one is allowed to beat you." This news byte was then seen on evening news that catapulted then an unknown MiloÅ¡eviÄ to the forefront of the current debate about the problems on Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Since the 1974 Constitution, the Albanian controlled Kosovo communist officials in Kosovo had instituted a campaign of discrimination against non-Albanians, Serbs and other non-Albanians like the Roma, Turks and Macedonians, were fired from jobs and positions within the regional government apparatus. These repressions and grievances had been swept conveniently under the rug with the pretense of "Brotherhood and Unity" policy instituted by then already late Josip Broz Tito.  Any reasoning to the contradictory, was quickly silenced. To the party leaderships chagrin, Mr. MiloÅ¡eviÄ insisted on finding a solution for the Kosovo situation, he was quickly labeled as a reactionary.</p>
<p> 
In order to save his skin, MiloÅ¡eviÄ fought back and established a political coup d'etat. He gained effective leadership and control of the Serbian Communist party and pressed forward with the one issue that had catapulted him to the forefront of the political limelight, which was Kosovo. This By the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and <a href='Vojvodina'>Vojvodina</a>.&lt;ref name="reuters19880730"&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a name="Kosovo_and_the_breakup_of_Yugoslavia"></a><h4>Kosovo and the breakup of Yugoslavia</h4><p>Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, complained about mistreatment from the Albanian majority.  Milosevic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.  In 1987, Serbian President Ivan StamboliÄ sent MiloÅ¡eviÄ to Kosovo to "pacify restive Serbs in Kosovo." On that trip, MiloÅ¡eviÄ broke away from a meeting with ethnic Albanians to mingle with angry Serbians in a suburb of Pristina. As the Serbs protested they were being pushed back by police with batons, MiloÅ¡eviÄ told them, "No one is allowed to beat you."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/kosovo/stories/past/milosevic/&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident was later seen as pivotal to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise to power.</p>
<p> 
On June 28, 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ delivered a speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a>. Many think that this speech helped MiloÅ¡eviÄ consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, What's next for Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ?&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations but was not recognized internationally. With an <em>80%</em> turnout, <em>98%</em> voted for Kosovo to be independent.</p>
<a name="Kosovo_War"></a><h4>Kosovo War</h4><p>{{main|Kosovo War}}
One of the events that contributed to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise of power was the <em>Gazimestan Speech</em>, delivered in front of 100,000 Serb citizens at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a> on 28 June, 1989. Soon afterwards the autonomy of Kosovo was reduced. After <a href='Slovenia'>Slovenia</a>'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, MiloÅ¡eviÄ used the seat to attain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents.</p>
<p> 
Albanians organized a peaceful separatist movement. State institutions and elections were boycotted and separate Albanian schools and political institutions were established. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a>, <a href='1990'>1990</a> Kosovo Parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, this was only recognized by Albania. In September of that year, the parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of <a href='KaÃ§anik'>KaÃ§anik</a>, adopted the <em>Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo</em>. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organisations but was not recognized internationally. With an 80% turnout, 98% voted for Kosovo to be independent.</p>
<p>With the events in <a href='Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia'>Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia</a> and <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> coming to an end, the Serb government started relocating Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia all over Serbia, including in Kosovo. In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make room for the refugees.</p>
<p>After the <a href='Dayton'>Dayton</a> Agreement in 1995, some Albanians organized into the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA), employing guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and civilians. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities was forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement led by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of <a href='Racak'>Racak</a>. The victims had been executed by Serb forces &lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1812847.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The so-called Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at <a href='Rambouillet'>Rambouillet</a>. After more than a month of negotations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has beeen argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).</p>
<p>This triggered a 78-day <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> campaign in <a href='1999'>1999</a>. At first limited to military targets in Kosovo proper, the bombing campaign was soon extended to cover targets all over Yugoslavia, including bridges, power stations, factories, broadcasting stations, post offices, and various government buildings.</p>
<p> 
During the conflict roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo, several thousand were killed (the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed). An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict. Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Women even though they were not combatants experienced many atrocities during Kosovo war, especially Albanian women.  Serbian army and police who had used rape as a weapon during the war in Bosnia, used rape also in Kosovo and the intention was to weaken the morale of Albanians. It is believed some 20,000 Albanian women were raped during the Kosovo war, but since rapes are associated with shame, many women after reporting this to different international humanitarian organizations have kept it secret. Some of the raped women have committed suicide after the war &lt;ref&gt;http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,194119,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.vajzat.com/eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; .</p>
<p> 
Some of the worst massacres against civilian Albanians occurred after that NATO started the bombing of Yugoslavia. Cuska massacre&lt;ref&gt;http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/kosovo/cuska/cuska_frameset.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Podujevo massacre &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/balkans/crimesandcourage.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Velika Krusa massacre&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/inside_kosovo/velika_krusa.stm&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the massacres committed by Serbian army, police and paramilitary.</p>
<p>During the Kosovo War, Serbs also engaged in a deliberate campaign of cultural destruction and rampage. According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated. The report concludes that most mosques were deliberately set on fire with no sign of fighting around the area. Among numerous other things, the following important objects were destroyed because they represented Albanian as well as Muslim and Catholic cultures:</p>
<p>Sinan Pasha Mosque in Prizren, the Prizren League Museum, the Hadum Mosque complex in Gjakova (Serbian: Djakovica); the historic bazaars in Gjakova and PeÄ (Albanian: Peja); the Roman Catholic church of St. Anthony in Gjakova; and two old Ottoman bridges, Ura e Terzive (Terzijski most) and Ura e Tabakeve (Tabacki most), near Gjakova.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/kosovo/herscherriedlmayer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Kosovo that established the <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister.  Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year).  UNMIK oversaw the establishment of a professional, multi-ethnic Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>  
In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War.  The <a href='2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004'>2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004</a> was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots.  Kosovo Albanians mobs burned hundreds of Serbian houses, Serbian Orthodox Church sites (including some medieval churches and monasteries) and UN facilities. Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending. International prosecutors and judges handled the most sensitive cases&lt;ref&gt;U.S State Department Report, published in 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.</p>

In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>

<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>
<p>  
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>.  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>13</a> ", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>14</a> ", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.

Whilst Serbia's continued sovereignty over Kosovo is recognised by the international community, a clear majority of the province's population would prefer independence.</p>
<p> 
The <a href='UN'>UN</a>-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock'>16</a> ", <em>BBC News</em>, October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 a draft resolution, backed by the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, the <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a>, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on <a href='20 July'>20 July</a> <a href='2007'>2007</a>, having failed to secure Russian backing.

<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale.
