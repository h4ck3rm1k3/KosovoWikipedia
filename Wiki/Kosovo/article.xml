'''Kosovo''' &lt;!--Please leave the following language order as Albanian followed by Serbian: this is alphabetical and as neutral as we can get. Serbian is listed first in the infobox as balance--&gt;([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: {{lang|sr-Cyrl|Косово и Метохија}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo i Metohija}}, [[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosova'' or ''Kosovë'', [[Transliteration|transliterated]] {{lang|sr-Latn|''Kosovo i Metohija''}}; also {{lang|sr-Cyrl|Космет}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|Kosmet}}, transliterated {{lang|sr-Latn|''Kosmet''}}) is a province of [[Serbia]] which has been under [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|administration]] since [[1999]]. While Serbia's [[sovereignty]] is recognised by the international community, in practice Serbian governance in the province is virtually non-existent (see also [[Constitutional status of Kosovo]]). The province is governed by the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) with the help of the local [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG), as well as security provided by the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR). 

Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It has a population of just over 1.6 million people, predominantly ethnic [[Albanians]], with smaller populations of [[Serbs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Romani people]], and other ethnic groups. [[largest import and export market (averaging €220 million and €9 million, respectively), followed by Serbia-Montenegro (€111 million and €5 million), Germany and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVO/147270-1121700806276/20953280/Kosovo_Economic_Briefing_april.pdf Kosovo Economic Briefing (April)], worldbank.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and used by UNMIK and the government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian [[Dinar]] is used in the Serbian populated parts.

The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm Brussels offers first Kosovo loan]&quot;, BBC News Online, 3 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovo.undp.org/Projects/TIK/tik.asp ''Transparency Initiative for Kosovo (TIK)''], UN Development Programme in Kosovo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimate from 2000-2002-2003 goes (a 1,600,000 strong population):
* 0% [[Albanians]]  
*9 7% [[Serbs]]
* 2% [[Bosniaks]] and [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorans]]
* 1% [[Roma people|Roma]]
* 1% [[Turkish people|Turks]]

Sunni Muslims account for more than 90% of the population in Kosovo&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism and Orthodoxy are also practiced by the people.

Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the largest population growth in Europe. [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml] [http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Kosovo/demographic-explosion.html] The people’s growth rate in Kosovo is 1.3%. Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew 4.6 times. If growth continues at such a pace, based on some estimations, the population will be 4.5 million by 2050.

[[Music]] has always been a part of the [[Culture of Albania|Albanian]] and [[Serbian culture]]. Although in Kosovo music is diverse (as it got mixed with the cultures of different regimes dominating in Kosovo), authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. The Albanian one is characterized by use of ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''.
In Kosovo, along with modern music, [[folk]] music is very popular. There are many folk [[singers]] and ensembles (both Albanian and Serbian). [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at [[universities]] (at the [[University of Pristina#Albanian university|University of Prishtina Faculty of Arts]]  and the [[University of Pristina#Serbian university|University of Priština at Kosovska Mitrovica]]  [[Faculty of Arts of Priština|Faculty of Arts]]) and several pre-[[college]] [[List of pre-college music schools|music school]]s
