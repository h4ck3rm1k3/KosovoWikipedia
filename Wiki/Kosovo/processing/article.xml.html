<p>Following the <a href='Slavic migrations'>Slavic migrations</a> between the 5th and 8th century, the <a href='Albanian language'>Albanian language</a> was marginalized to the mountainous areas of Dardania. The area remained part of the <a href='Byzantine empire'>Byzantine empire</a> until the 9th century, when it was conquered by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire</a>.  
Later it was briefly returned to the Byzantines, before it was absorbed into <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> in the late 12th century, and was part of the <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a> from 1346 to 1371. In 1389, in the famous <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> a coalition of Christian armies  led by the Serbian prince <a href='Lazar Hrebljanovic'>Lazar Hrebljanovic</a> was defeated by the <a href='Ottoman Turks'>Ottoman Turks</a>, who finally took control of the territory in <a href='1455'>1455</a>.

The Ottoman conquest of Kosovo was a major achievement for the Turks, as the Kosovar rich minerals would prove a great asset to their empire. The establishment of Ottoman institutions in Kosova brought about a new era. The Catholic population was in a constant state of disfavor with the new regime, while the Orthodox Church had been placed under the protection of Ottoman monarchs. This status of the Roman Catholic Church led to a systematic oppression of its members. Likewise, heavy religiously-selective taxation and threats to national assimilation by forceful absorption into the Serbian Orthodox Church led to a mass conversion of Christian Albanians into <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>. The new religion was embraced by approximately two-thirds of the Albanians, while it slightly improved their status by preserving their national identity before the Serbian peril, it did not rule out the struggle against the Ottoman regime.</p>
<p>Kosovo was a typical redoubt of defiant people who fought against the new regime in quest for their national liberty. As a result, many Albanian highlanders retained some autonomy and were allowed to apply their customary law (mainly the <a href='Kanun|Kanun of LekÃ« Dukagjini'>Kanun|Kanun of LekÃ« Dukagjini</a>). Nevertheless, examples of Ottoman attempts to give an end to this practice are abundant; the heroine Nora of the Kelmendi clan earned a distinguished place in Kosovar history by assassinating the Ottoman leader in Kosovo.</p>
<p>During the Ottoman period, nonetheless, there was recorded a great amount of endeavors to promote the Albanian language and culture. The Catholic cleric who authored the earliest known Albanian book, <a href='Gjon Buzuku'>Gjon Buzuku</a>, is believed to have been born in Kosovo. Moreover, the Catholic bishop, <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>, a native of Kosovo, published his classic <em>Band of the Prophets</em> in 1686, and later headed the anti-Ottoman movement. His engagement in the national cause culminated in 1689, when he raised a 20,000-member army comprised of Christian and Muslim Albanians, who joined the Austrians in their war against Turkey. The campaign resulted in a brief liberation of Kosovo, but after a plague breakout among Austrians and Kosovars, the Turks soon recovered all their lost areas. Bogdani himself died in December 1689, while his remains were inhumanely exhumed by Turks and Tatars and fed to dogs.&lt;ref&gt; <a href='http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors1/AA1-01.html PjetÃ«r Bogdani, biography by R. Elsie, <em>Albanian Literature</em>'>5</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The loss had a negative impact on the wellbeing all inhabitants of Kosovo, whose liberation was not realized in an 18th-century Austrian endeavor either.</p>
<a name="Albanian_national_movement"></a><h4>Albanian national movement</h4><p>{{main|Albanian nationalism }}
{{see|National Awakening in the Balkans}}</p>
<p>The Albanian national movement was inspired by various reasons. Besides from the National Renaissance that had been promoted by Albanian activists, political reasons were a contributing factor. In the 1870s the Ottoman Empire experienced a tremendous contraction in territory and defeats in wars against Slavic monarchies of Europe. During the 1877â1878 Russo-Turkish war, the Serbian troops invaded the northeastern part of the province of Kosovo <a href='Albanian exodus|deporting'>Albanian exodus|deporting</a> 160,000 ethnic Albanians from 640 localities. Furthermore, the signing of the <a href='Treaty of San Stefano'>Treaty of San Stefano</a> marked the beginning of a difficult situation for the Albanian people in the Balkans, whose lands were to be ceded from Turkey to Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Bep Jubani et al., <em>Historia e popullit shqiptar: pÃ«r shkollat e mesme</em> (Libri Shkollor: PrishtinÃ«, 2002) 149-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; <a href='http://historia.shqiperia.com/rilindja/kreu_5.php Historia e ShqipÃ«risÃ«, âKreu V: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenitâ Shqiperia.com'>6</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Fearing the partitioning of Albanian-inhabited lands among the newly founded Balkan kingdoms, the Albanians established their <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> on <a href='June 10'>June 10</a>, <a href='1878'>1878</a>, three days prior to the Congress of Berlin that would revise the decisions of San Stefano.&lt;ref&gt;Arsh et al., <em>Histori e shkurtÃ« e ShqipnisÃ«</em> (Rilindja: PrishtinÃ«, 1967) 104-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the League was founded with the support of the Sultan who hoped for the preservation of Ottoman territories, the Albanian leaders were quick and effective enough to turn it into a national organization and eventually into a government. The League had the backing of the <a href='ArbÃ«reshÃ«|Italo-Albanian'>ArbÃ«reshÃ«|Italo-Albanian</a> community and had well developed into a unifying factor for the religiously-diverse Albanian people. During its three years of existence the League sought the creation of an Albanian autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire, raised an army and fought a defensive war. In 1881 a provisional government was formed to administer Albania under the presidency of <a href='Ymer Prizreni'>Ymer Prizreni</a>, assisted by prominent ministers such as <a href='Abdyl FrashÃ«ri'>Abdyl FrashÃ«ri</a> and <a href='Sulejman Vokshi'>Sulejman Vokshi</a>. Nevertheless, military intervention from the Balkan states, the Great Powers as well as Turkey divided the Albanian troops in three fronts, which brought about the end of the League.&lt;ref&gt;Bep Jubani et al., <em>Historia e popullit shqiptar: pÃ«r shkollat e mesme</em> (Libri Shkollor: PrishtinÃ«, 2002) 149-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; <a href='http://historia.shqiperia.com/rilindja/kreu_5.php Historia e ShqipÃ«risÃ«, âKreu V: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenitâ Shqiperia.com'>7</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arsh et al., <em>Histori e shkurtÃ« e ShqipnisÃ«</em> (Rilindja: PrishtinÃ«, 1967) 104-116.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Kosovo was yet home to other Albanian organizations, the most important being the <a href='League of Peja'>League of Peja</a>, named after the city in which it was founded in 1899. It was led by <a href='Haxhi Zeka'>Haxhi Zeka</a>, a former member of the League of Prizren and shared a similar platform in quest for an autonomous Albania. The League ended its activity in 1900 after an armed conflict with the Ottoman forces. Zeka was assassinated by a Serbian agent in 1902 with the backing of the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Bep Jubani et al., <em>Historia e popullit shqiptar: pÃ«r shkollat e mesme</em> (Libri Shkollor: PrishtinÃ«, 2002) 182-185.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

The demands of the <a href='Young Turks'>Young Turks</a> in early 20th century sparked support from the Albanians, who were hoping for a betterment of their national status, primarily recognition of their language for use in offices and education. In 1908, 20,000 armed Albanian peasants gathered in <a href='Ferizaj'>Ferizaj</a> to prevent any foreign intervention, while their leaders, <a href='Bajram Curri'>Bajram Curri</a> and <a href='Isa Boletini'>Isa Boletini</a>, sent a telegram to the sultan demanding the promulgation of a constitution and the opening of the parliament.
The Albanians did not receive any of the promised benefits from the Young Turkish victory. Considering this, an unsuccessful uprising was organized by Albanian highlanders in Kosovo in February 1909. The adversity escalated after the takeover of the Turkish government by an oligarchic group later that year. In April 1910, armies led by <a href='Idriz Seferi'>Idriz Seferi</a> and Isa Boletini rebelled against the Turkish troops, but were finally forced to withdraw after having caused many casualties amongst the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bep Jubani et al., <em>Historia e popullit shqiptar: pÃ«r shkollat e mesme</em> (Libri Shkollor: PrishtinÃ«, 2002) 191-198.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

In the Kingdom, Kosovo was split into four countiesâthree being a part of the entity of Serbia: ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since <a href='26 April'>26 April</a> <a href='1922'>1922</a> split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>.

In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition as a Republic within the Yugoslav Federation, while extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. &lt;!-- Tito's regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution.

Even though Kosovo was the least developed area of the former Yugoslavia, the living and economic prospects and freedoms were far greater than under the totalitarian <a href='Enver Hoxha|Hoxha'>Enver Hoxha|Hoxha</a> regime in Albania.</p>
<p>Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia.

<p>In <a href='1986'>1986</a>, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a>, a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>9</a>.

<a name="Kosovo_and_the_breakup_of_Yugoslavia"></a><h4>Kosovo and the breakup of Yugoslavia</h4><p>Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, complained about mistreatment from the Albanian majority.  MiloÅ¡evic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.  MiloÅ¡eviÄ was sent by Ivan StaboliÄ to meet with local leaders because the local Serbs were threatening to organize a demonstration in Belgrade.&lt;ref&gt;The Serbs Tim Judah p162&lt;/ref&gt; However a large demonstration of Serbian nationalists had been organized to coincide with MiloÅ¡eviÄ's arrival.  When the demonstrators broke through the police cordon the police got out their batons and the situation began to get ugly. At this point MiloÅ¡eviÄ went to a window and and declared "Nobody must ever again dare to beat these people."  Afterwards he agreed to listen to representatives of the Serbs who aired their grievances - this continued to the next morning. &lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare.

Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states.

<p>After the <a href='Dayton Agreement'>Dayton Agreement</a> in 1995, some Albanians organized into the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA), employing guerrilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of Serbian civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities were forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement devised by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo.

On January 16 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of <a href='Racak'>Racak</a>.

<p>However, according to the German newspaper "Berliner Zeitung," Finnish pathologist Helena Ranta, who was assigned by the EU as the head of the team sent to investigate the Racak incident,{{fact|date=February 2008}} "...expressed lack of comprehension regarding the work of the UN's Hague tribunal in the case of the so-called massacre of Racak." Ranta also criticized that "...Indications of serious fighting between Serbian soldiers and Albanian fighters on the night of 15th to 16th of January, 1999, in the Racak area had been inadequately pursued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosovo.net/erpkiminfo_jan04/erpkiminfo19jan04.html |title="Racak case" in public focus again |author=KiM Info-Service |date=19/01/04}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> 
The Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at <a href='Rambouillet'>Rambouillet</a>. After more than a month of negotiations, Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has been argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).{{fact|date=February 2008}}</p>

Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending.

The <a href='UN'>UN</a>-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock'>17</a> ", <em>BBC News</em>, October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> 
In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, the <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a>, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29/06/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date=09/07/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=30/03/07 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG). The PISG replaced the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to MiloÅ¡evic's rule. The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006. The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj. Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora." Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly. After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>

Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005. He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK). But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>. Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs. The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death.
