<p>During the <a href='Neolithic'>Neolithic</a> period, the region of Kosovo lay within the extent of the <a href='VinÄa-TurdaÅ culture'>VinÄa-TurdaÅ culture</a>. In the fourth to third centuries  BC, it was the territory of the <a href='Thraco-Illyrian'>Thraco-Illyrian</a> tribe of the <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a>, forming part of the  kingdom of <a href='Illyria'>Illyria</a>. The Illyrians were conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and made the Roman province of <a href='Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum'>Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum</a> in 59 BC. The Kosovo region became part of <a href='Moesia Superior'>Moesia Superior</a> in AD 87. The <a href='Slavic migrations'>Slavic migrations</a> reached the Balkans in the sixth to seventh century. The area was absorbed into the <a href='Byzantine empire'>Byzantine empire</a> in the 850s. As the center of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, it often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> conquered it by the end of the 11th century.</p>
<p>Fully absorbed into the Serbian Kingdom until the end of the twelfth century, it became the secular and spiritual center of the <a href='History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state'>History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state</a> of the <a href='House of NemanjiÄ|Nemanyiden'>House of NemanjiÄ|Nemanyiden</a> dynasty in the thirteenth century, with the Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church in <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a>, while <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> was the secular center. The zenith was reached with the formation of a <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a> in 1346, which after 1371 transformed from a centralized absolutist medieval monarchy to a feudal realm. Kosovo became the hereditary land of the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ</a> and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a> and <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a> flourished.</p>
<p>In the 1389  <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, Ottoman forces defeated a coalition led by <a href='Lazar HrebeljanoviÄ'>Lazar HrebeljanoviÄ</a>.
In 1402 a <a href='Serbian Despotate'>Serbian Despotate</a> was raised and Kosovo became its richest territory, famous for mines.
The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in 1439.
During the first fall of Serbia <a href='Novo Brdo'>Novo Brdo</a> and Kosovo offered last resistance to the invading Ottomans in 1441, in 1455 it was finally and fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Kosovo was part of the <a href='Ottoman Empire'>Ottoman Empire</a> from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the <a href='eyalet'>eyalet</a> of <a href='Rumelia'>Rumelia</a>, and from 1864 as a <a href='Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|separate province'>Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|separate province</a>.

<p>Kosovo was briefly taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683&amp;ndash;1699 with help of 6,000 led by <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. In 1690, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a>  led 37,000 families out of Kosovo. Other migrations of Orthodox Christians from the Kosovo area continued throughout the eighteenth century.
In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of Christians in Kosovo deteriorated, including full imposition of <a href='jizya'>jizya</a> (taxation of non-Muslims).</p>

<p>In 1871, a Serbian meeting was held in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory.  In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of PriÅ¡tina and <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>Kosovska Mitrovica</a> under civil Serbian control,  and outside Ottoman jurisdiction, while the rest of Kosovo remained under Ottoman control. As a response, ethnic Albanians formed the  <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a>, pursuing  political aspirations of a <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>Greater Albania|unified Albanian people</a> under the Ottoman umbrella.

<p>The <a href='Young Turk'>Young Turk</a> movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from PriÅ¡tina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911.

An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. This was described by <a href='Leon Trotsky'>Leon Trotsky</a>, who was a reporter for the <em><a href='Pravda'>Pravda</a></em> newspaper at the time.

<p>In the winter of 1915-1916, during <a href='World War I'>World War I</a>, Kosovo saw a large exodus of the Serbian army which became known as the <em>Great Serbian Retreat</em>, as Kosovo was occupied by <a href='Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians'>Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians</a> and <a href='Austro-Hungarians'>Austro-Hungarians</a>.

<a name="Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_and_World_War_II"></a><h4>Kingdom of Yugoslavia and World War II</h4><p>The 1918&amp;ndash;1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region. Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of  Serbia (ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since <a href='26 April'>26 April</a> <a href='1922'>1922</a> split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>.  In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Yugoslavia'>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the <a href='Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta'>Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta</a>, the <a href='Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava'>Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava</a> and the <a href='Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar'>Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar</a>.

<p>The province was first formed in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area to protect its regional <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> majority within the <a href='People's Republic of Serbia'>People's Republic of Serbia</a> as a member of the <a href='SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia'>SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia</a> under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, <a href='Josip Broz Tito'>Josip Broz Tito</a>, but with no actual autonomy. After Yugoslavia's name change to the <a href='Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> and Serbia's to the <a href='Socialist Republic of Serbia'>Socialist Republic of Serbia</a> in 1953, Kosovo gained internal autonomy in the 1960s. In the 1974 constitution, the <a href='Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo'>Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo</a>'s government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia.

The ethnic balance of Kosovo tilted as the number of Albanians tripled, rising from almost 75% to over 90%, but the number of Serbs barely increased, dropping from 15% to 8% of the total population. Even though Kosovo was the least developed area of the former Yugoslavia, the living and economic prospects and freedoms were far greater than under the totalitarian <a href='Enver Hoxha|Hoxha'>Enver Hoxha|Hoxha</a> regime in Albania.

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s.

On <a href='June 28'>June 28</a> <a href='1989'>1989</a>, MiloÅ¡eviÄ delivered a speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a>. Many think that this speech helped MiloÅ¡eviÄ consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;<em>The Economist</em>, June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, "What's next for Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ?"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, the <em>Republic of Kosova</em>.   The Republic of Kosova was formally disbanded in 2000 when its institutions were replaced by the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> established by the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK). During its lifetime, the Republic of Kosova was only recognized by <a href='Albania'>Albania</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a> was initially a conflict between <a href='Serbs|Serbian'>Serbs|Serbian</a> and <a href='Yugoslavia|Yugoslav'>Yugoslavia|Yugoslav</a> security forces and the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA), an ethnic <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> guerrilla group  identified by some as terrorist.<a href='http://judiciary.house.gov/Legacy/muts1213.htm'>6</a>, seeking secession from the former Yugoslavia.  In 1998 Western interest had increased and the Serbian authorities were compelled to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement devised by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs.</p>
<p>The Serbs then began to escalate the conflict, using military and paramilitary forces in another <a href='ethnic cleansing'>ethnic cleansing</a> campaign this time against against the Kosovar Albanians.  An estimated 300,000 refugees were displaced during the winter of 1998, many left without adequate food or shelter, precipitating a humanitarian crisis and calls for intervention by the international community.</p>

{{Politics of Kosovo}}

In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG). The PISG replaced the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to MiloÅ¡evic's rule. The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006. The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj. Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora." Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly. After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>

Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005. He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK). But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>. Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.

<a name="Economy"></a><h2>Economy</h2><p>{{main|Economy of Kosovo}}
Kosovo has one of the most under-developed economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at <a href='Euro|â¬'>Euro|â¬1</a>,565 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=Kosovo Brief 2006 |author=The World Bank |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, "Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries"&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, international sanctions, poor external commerce and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=World Bank Mission in Kosovo |author=The World Bank |date=2006/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in <a href='Gross Domestic Product'>Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. <a href='Inflation'>Inflation</a> is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 |title=May finds Kosovo with 50% unemployed |author=eciks |date=04/05/06}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm |title=Brussels offers first Kosovo loan |author=BBC News |date=03/05/05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a "zero tolerance" approach.</p>
