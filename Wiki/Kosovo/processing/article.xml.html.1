]Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamicisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organized along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the Sar range).

<p>]Albanians, steadily increasing in number, have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, the earlier ethnic composition being disputed. Kosovo's political boundaries do not coincide with ethnic boundaries; Serbs form a local majority in[ <a href='North Kosovo'>]North Kosovo[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Kosovo Serb enclaves|several smaller enclaves'>]Kosovo Serb enclaves|several smaller enclaves[<\/a>], while there are large areas with Albanian majority outside Kosovo in the neighbouring regions of former Yugoslavia, namely in the Northwest of the[ <a href='Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia'>]Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia[<\/a> ]and in[ <a href='Presevo'>]Presevo[<\/a> ]of[ <a href='Central Serbia'>]Central Serbia[<\/a>]..[][<\/p>

If growth continues at such a pace, the population will reach 4.5[&amp;]nbsp;million by 2050.[&lt;]ref[&gt;<a href='http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20080212143112\/http:\/\/kosovo-hotels.com\/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosovo-Hotels, PrishtinÃ«'>]51[<\/a>&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]However, this is unlikely to happen; until about 1990, Kosovo Albanians had very high birth rates of about 4 children per woman, similar to many poor developing countries (such as[ <a href='Haiti'>]Haiti[<\/a> ]or[ <a href='Ghana'>]Ghana[<\/a>]), but this has fallen down to about two since then and will likely sink below replacement eventually, as it has in[ <a href='Albania'>]Albania[<\/a> ]itself. In addition, Kosovo has a high emigration rate now which it did not have before 1990..[][<\/p>
<p>]By contrast, from[ <a href='Demographics of Kosovo#World War II-1968|1948'>]Demographics of Kosovo#World War II-1968|1948[<\/a> ]to[ <a href='Demographics of Kosovo#1989-1999: Centralized Yugoslav Control|1991'>]Demographics of Kosovo#1989-1999: Centralized Yugoslav Control|1991[<\/a>], the Serb population of Kosovo increased by but twelve percent (one third the growth of the population in Central Serbia). The population of Albanians in Kosovo increased by three hundred percent in the same period a rate of growth twenty-five times that of the Serbs in Kosovo. Serbs, similar to most other[ <a href='Eastern Europe'>]Eastern European[<\/a> ]Christian ethnic groups, since about 1990 have had very low birth rates (about 1.5 children per woman) and more deaths than births. This ensures a continued dwindling of the Serb minority as a percentage of the population, even with the dropping births among the Albanians..[][<\/p>
