<p> 
The province is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the <a href='Yugoslavia|Yugoslav'>Yugoslavia|Yugoslav</a>) government and Kosovo's Albanian population. International negotiations began in <a href='2006'>2006</a> to determine the final status of Kosovo (<em>See <a href='Kosovo Status Process'>Kosovo Status Process</a></em>).</p>

<a name="Ancient"></a><h3>Ancient</h3><p>The region of Kosovo has been inhabited by <a href='Illyrians|Illyrian tribes'>Illyrians|Illyrian tribes</a>(ancient Albanians) since the <a href='Bronze Age'>Bronze Age</a>. In ancient times, the area was known as <a href='Dardania (Europe)|Dardania'>Dardania (Europe)|Dardania</a> and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The south of Kosovo was ruled by <a href='Macedon'>Macedonia</a> since <a href='Alexander the Great'>Alexander the Great</a>'s reign in the 4th century BC. The local <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a> were of <a href='Illyrian'>Illyrian</a> stock. Illyrians resisted rule by the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading imperial powers, the region was eventually occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a> in 28 BC and became part of the Roman province of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a>. After <a href='85|AD 85'>85|AD 85</a> it was part of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a> Superior. Emperor <a href='Diocletian'>Diocletian</a> later c. <a href='284'>284</a> made Dardania into separate province with its capital at Naissus (<a href='NiÅ¡'>NiÅ¡</a>). Illyrians were among the first people to accept Christianity as they were evangelized by <a href='St. Paul'>St. Paul</a>. Illyria is twice mentioned in the <a href='Bible'>Bible</a>. When the Roman Empire split in <a href='Anno Domini|A.D.'>Anno Domini|A.D.</a> <a href='395'>395</a>, the area of Kosovo came under the <a href='Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire'>Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire</a>, the <a href='Byzantine Empire'>Byzantine Empire</a>. Many inhabitants of Dardania became leaders in Rome and <a href='Constantinopolis'>Constantinopolis</a>, including <a href='Justinian the Great'>Justinian the Great</a>.</p>
<a name="Medieval"></a><h3>Medieval</h3><a name="Great_migrations_and_interregnums"></a><h4>Great migrations and interregnums</h4><p><a href='Slavic people|Slavs'>Slavic people|Slavs</a> came to the territories that form modern Kosovo in the <a href='7th century|seventh-century'>7th century|seventh-century</a> migrations of <a href='White Serbs'>White Serbs</a>, with the largest influx of migrants in the 630s; although the region was increasingly populated by Slavs since the sixth or even fifth century. These Slavs were <a href='Christianization|Christianized'>Christianization|Christianized</a> in several waves between the <a href='7th century|seventh'>7th century|seventh</a> and <a href='9th century|ninth century'>9th century|ninth century</a>, with the last wave taking place between <a href='867'>867</a> and <a href='874'>874</a>. The northwestern part of Kosovo, <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, became a part of the Byzantine <a href='Serb'>Serb</a> vassal state the <a href='Principality of Rascia'>Principality of Rascia</a>, with <a href='Desnik|Dostinik'>Desnik|Dostinik</a> as the principality's capital.</p>
<p>In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire</a>. Although <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> restored control over <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> throughout the <a href='10th century|tenth century'>10th century|tenth century</a>, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire in a period of Bulgarian decline. However, Tsar <a href='Samuil of Bulgaria'>Samuil of Bulgaria</a> reconquered the whole of Kosovo in the late tenth century until the Byzantines restored their control over the area as they subjugated the Bulgarian Empire. In 1040-1041, Bulgarians, led by the Samuil of Bulgaria's grandson Petar Delyan staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantine control over the region continued.</p>
<p> 
Throughout the following decades, numerous foreign peoples invading the Byzantine Empire stormed Kosovo, among them the <a href='Cumans'>Cumans</a>. In 1072, local Bulgarians, under George Voiteh, pushed a final attempt to restore Imperial Bulgarian power and invited the last heir of the <a href='House of Comitopuli'>House of Comitopuli</a> - <a href='Duklja'>Duklja</a>'s prince <a href='Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin'>Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin</a> of the <a href='House of Vojislavljevic'>House of Vojislavljevic</a>, son of the <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Mihailo Voislav'>Mihailo Voislav</a> - to assume power. The Serbs decided to conquer the entire Byzantine region of Bulgaria. King Mihailo dispatched his son with three hundred elite Serb fighters led by Duke Petrilo. Constantine Bodin was crowned in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> as <em>Petar III</em>, <a href='List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians'>List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar of the Bulgarians</a> by George Voiteh and the Slavic Boyars. The Empire swept across Byzantine territories in months, until the significant losses on the south had forced Czar Petar to withdraw. In 1073, the Byzantine forces chased Constantine Bodin, defeated his army at <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a>, and imprisoned him.</p>
<a name="Incorporation_into_Serbia"></a><h4>Incorporation into Serbia</h4><p>The full Serbian takeover was carried out under a branch of the <a href='House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav'>House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav</a> <a href='Grand Prince'>Grand Princes</a> of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a>. In <a href='1093'>1093</a>, Prince Vukan advanced on <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The Byzantine Emperor himself came to <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a> for negotiations. ZveÄan served as the Byzantine line-of-defence against constant invasions from the neighboring Serbs. A peace agreement was made, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. Vukan's armies stormed Kosovo. In <a href='1094'>1094</a>, <a href='Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius'>Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius</a> attempted to renew peace negotiations in Ulpiana. A new peace agreement was concluded and Vukan handed over hostages to the Emperor, including his two nephews UroÅ¡ and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the conflict in <a href='1106'>1106</a>, once again defeating John Comnenus's army. However, his death halted the total Serb conquest of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In <a href='1166'>1166</a>, a Serbian nobleman from <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a>, <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>Stefan Nemanja</a>, the founder of the <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja</a> ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a>. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the <a href='Sitnica'>Sitnica</a> river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilities, but in <a href='1183'>1183</a>, Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the <a href='Hungarians'>Hungarians</a> after the death of <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a> in <a href='1180'>1180</a>, marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Nemanja's son, <a href='Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II'>Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II</a>, recorded that the border of the Serbian realm reached the river of Lab. Grand Prince Stephen II completed the inclusion of the Kosovo territories under Serb rule in 1208, by which time he had conquered Prizren and Lipljan, and moved the border of territory under his control to the Å ar mountain.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_the_Serbs"></a><h4>Kingdom of the Serbs</h4><p>In <a href='1217'>1217</a>, the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom'>History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom</a> achieved recognition. In <a href='1219'>1219</a>, an autocephalous <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was created, with <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, Prizren and Lipljan being the Orthodox Christian <a href='Episcopates'>Episcopates</a> on Kosovo. By the end of the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, the centre of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church</a> was moved to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> from <a href='Å½iÄa'>Å½iÄa</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href='13th century|thirteenth century'>13th century|thirteenth century</a>, Kosovo became the heart of the Serbian political and religious life, with the Å ar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was in Pauni. On an island was <a href='SvrÄin'>SvrÄin</a>, and on the coast <a href='Å timlji'>Å timlji</a>, and in the mountains was the Castle of <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating, and as the rulers' living quarters. After 1291, the Tartars broke all the way to PeÄ. <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a> managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the <a href='Mother of Christ'>Mother of Christ</a> of LjeviÅ¡ka in Prizren around 1307, which became the seat of the Prizren Bishopric, and the magnificent <a href='GraÄanica monastery'>GraÄanica monastery</a> in 1335, the seat of the Lipljan Bishopric. In 1331, the juvenile King DuÅ¡an attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in Nerodimlje. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of <a href='PetriÄ'>PetriÄ</a>, but DuÅ¡an captured him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palaiologos and their children in ZveÄan, where the dethroned King died on <a href='11 November'>11 November</a> <a href='1331'>1331</a>.</p>
<p>In 1327 and 1328, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani started forming the vast DeÄani domain, although, Serbian King DuÅ¡an would finish it in 1335. Stefan of Dechani issued the Dechani Charter in 1330, listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne.</p>
<a name="Serbian_Empire_and_Despotate"></a><h4>Serbian Empire and Despotate</h4><p><a href='Monarch|King'>Monarch|King</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren in <a href='1342'>1342</a>â<a href='1352'>1352</a>. The Kingdom was transformed into an <a href='Serbian Empire|Empire'>Serbian Empire|Empire</a> in 1345 and officially in 1346. Stefan DuÅ¡an received <a href='John VI Cantacuzenus'>John VI Cantacuzenus</a> in <a href='1342'>1342</a> in his Castle in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In <a href='1346'>1346</a>, the Serbian <a href='Archbishopric|Archepiscopric'>Archbishopric|Archepiscopric</a> at PeÄ was upgraded into a <a href='Patriarchate'>Patriarchate</a>, but it was not recognized before <a href='1370'>1370</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the Empire fell into disarray prior to DuÅ¡an's death in <a href='1355'>1355</a>, feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar <a href='Stefan UroÅ¡ V'>Stefan UroÅ¡ V</a>. Kosovo became a domain of the <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ</a>, but Prince Voislav VoinoviÄ expanded his demesne further into Kosovo. The armies of King <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ</a> from <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a> and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in <a href='1369'>1369</a>, putting a halt to his advances. After the <a href='Battle of Marica'>Battle of Marica</a> on <a href='26 September'>26 September</a> <a href='1371'>1371</a>, in which the MrnjavÄeviÄ brothers lost their lives, <a href='House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ'>House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ</a> of <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a> took Prizren and PeÄ in <a href='1372'>1372</a>. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the <a href='Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ'>Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> invaded and met the Christian coalition of Serbs, Albanians, and Vlachs under <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> on <a href='28 June'>28 June</a> <a href='1389'>1389</a>, near <a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a>, at Gazi Mestan. The Serbian Army was assisted by various allies. The epic <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the Ottomans had 140,000. Through the cunning of <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a>, <a href='Sultan'>Sultan</a> <a href='Murad I|Murad'>Murad I|Murad</a> was killed and the new Sultan <a href='Beyazid'>Beyazid</a> had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> and <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> were canonised by the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> for their efforts in the battle. The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by the Albanian ruler Gjergj Kastrioti <a href='Skanderbeg'>Skanderbeg</a> on one side, and Ottoman troops supported by the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄs</a> in <a href='1448'>1448</a>. Skanderbeg's troops that were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the Serb forces of BrankoviÄ. Brankovic, as <a href='vassal'>vassal</a> to the Ottomans, was obligated to fight on their side against the Christian armies from Albania and Hungary. Hungarian King <a href='John Hunyadi'>John Hunyadi</a> lost the battle after a two-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the Ottoman Empire, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in 1459.</p>
<p> 
In 1455, new castles rose to prominence in PriÅ¡tina and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, centres of the Ottoman vassalaged <a href='House of BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ</a>.</p>

The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> brought <a href='Islamisation'>Islamisation</a> with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of <a href='1683'>1683</a>&amp;ndash;<a href='1699'>1699</a> with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a <a href='Catholic'>Catholic</a> <a href='Archbishop'>Archbishop</a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. In <a href='1690'>1690</a>, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a>, who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the Ottomans. The people that followed him were mostly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> abandonedâbut they were likely followed by other ethnic groups. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the <a href='18th century'>18th century</a>. It is also noted that some <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> adopted <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>, while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanians, adopting their culture and even language.</p>
<p> 
In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of <a href='Christians'>Christians</a> in Kosovo was greatly reduced. All previous privileges were lost, and the Christian population had to suffer the full weight of the Empire's extensive and losing wars, even having blame forced upon them for the losses.</p>

In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory.</p>

As a response, the Albanians formed the nationalistic and conservative <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> later the same year.

The Albanians joined and supported the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a>. As opposed to Serbian schools, numerous Albanian schools were opened during the 'occupation' (the majority Albanian population considered it a liberation).

Tens of thousands of soldiers died of starvation, extreme weather and Albanian attacks as they retreated towards the <a href='Allies'>Allies</a> in <a href='Corfu'>Corfu</a> and <a href='Thessaloniki'>Thessaloniki</a>, losing up to an estimated 100,000 dead along the way.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Transported away from the front lines, the Serbian Army was finally able to recuperate, with sick and injured soldiers receiving medical attention. Refreshed and regrouped, it decided to return to the battlefield. In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a> out of Kosovo, in turn committing atrocities against the Albanians.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Serbian Kosovo was unified with Montenegrin Metohija as Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia. After the World War I ended, the country was then transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians'>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians</a> (Albanian: <em>MbretÃ«ria Serbe, Kroate, Sllovene</em>, Serbo-Croatian: <em>Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca</em>) on <a href='1 December'>1 December</a> <a href='1918'>1918</a>, gathering territories gained in victory.</p>
<a name="1918-1945"></a><h4>1918-1945</h4><p>The peace treaties of 1919-1920 established a Yugoslav state with the name "The Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs".  The name was shortly changed to Yugoslavia. Kosovo was again an integral part of Serbia. The Kingdom was comprised of 12 million people, of whom 1,000,000 were Albanian.  It was overwhelmingly a Slavic state.  In contrast 80% of the population of Kosovo was Albanian, and of these three-quarters were Muslim. Administratively, Kosovo was split onto four countiesâthree being a part of the entity of Serbia: ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since <a href='26 April'>26 April</a> <a href='1922'>1922</a> split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>. In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Yugoslavia'>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>.

<p> 
Hostilities between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo increased and by 1921 Albanian Kosovars asked the <a href='League of Nations'>League of Nations</a> to unite Kosovo with Albania.  They alleged that 12,000 Albanians had been killed and 22,000 imprisoned in Kosovo since 1918. The League of Nations was unsympathetic and did not take action.  A <a href='Kachak'>Kachak</a> movement of armed Albanians seeking union with Albania developed. As a result Albanians in Kosovo were increasingly seen by Serbs as comprising an irridentist movement, subversive to the Yugoslav constitution. In the period 1918-1941, between the two world wars, colonization of Kosovo by Serbian settlers was attempted. Land was appropriated from Albanians illegally and Albanians were encouraged to leave. Some Albanians resisted. In 1931 the population of Kosovo remained 80% Albanian, so it is clear that, for a variety of reasons, the colonization movement had failed except for a few isolated Albanian towns that became more Serbian. The most notable proponent of the colonization policy was <a href='Vasa Cubrilovic'>Vasa Cubrilovic</a> (1898-1990), a Serb intellectual who advocated deporting the Albaninan population to Albania and Turkey. In the end it was not implemented due to lack of funds and the onset of the Second World War. Historians such as <a href='Noel Malcolm'>Noel Malcolm</a> estimate that during the period 1918-41 some 90.000 to 150.000 Albanians and other Muslims emigrated from Kosovo. &lt;ref&gt;Memorandum submitted by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, FRY/KOSOVO: SERBIAN PLANS FOR ETHNIC CLEANSING, HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND PRECEDENTS, 7 June 2000, <a href='http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmfaff/28/0031606.htm'>3</a>&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://lamar.colostate.edu/~grjan/kosovohistory.html'>4</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

Tito had pursued a policy of weakening Serbia, as he believed that a "Weak Serbia equals a strong Yugoslavia". To this end Vojvodina and Kosovo became autonomous regions and were given the above entitled privileges as defacto republics.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} <a href='Serbo-Croatian'>Serbo-Croatian</a>, <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> and <a href='Turkish language|Turkish'>Turkish language|Turkish</a> were defined as official languages on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Albanians and Serbs. In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. The ethnic balance of Kosovo witnessed disproportional increase as the number of <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> tripled gradually rising from almost 75% to over 90%, but the number of <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> barely increased and dropped in the full share of the total population from some 15% down to 8%.

<p>Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities"&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government.

<p>In <a href='1986'>1986</a>, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a>, a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>5</a>.

<p>  
MiloÅ¡eviÄ was initially sent there as a member of the Communists party . Initially MiloÅ¡eviÄ did not talk to the Serbian nationalists who were at that point demonstrating for rights and freedoms that had been denied to them. During these meetings he agreed to listen to their grievances. During the meeting, outside the building where this forum was taking place police started fighting the locals who had gathered there, mostly Serbs eager to voice their grievances. After hearing about the police brutality outside of the halls, MiloÅ¡eviÄ came out and in an emotional moment promised the local sebs that "Nobody would beat yo again." This news byte was then seen on evening news that catapulted then an unknown MiloÅ¡eviÄ to the forefront of the current debate about the problems on Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Since the 1974 Constitution, the Albanian-controlled communist officials in Kosovo had instituted a campaign of discrimination against non-Albanians. Serbs and other non-Albanians like the Roma, Turks and Macedonians, were fired from jobs and positions within the regional government apparatus.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} These repressions and grievances had been swept conveniently under the rug with the pretense of "Brotherhood and Unity" policy instituted by then already late Josip Broz Tito.  Any reasoning to the contradictory, was quickly silenced. To the party leaderships chagrin, Mr. MiloÅ¡eviÄ insisted on finding a solution for the Kosovo situation, he was quickly labeled as a reactionary.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}</p>
<p> 
In order to save his skin, MiloÅ¡eviÄ fought back and established a political coup d'etat. He gained effective leadership and control of the Serbian Communist party and pressed forward with the one issue that had catapulted him to the forefront of the political limelight, which was Kosovo. This By the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and <a href='Vojvodina'>Vojvodina</a>.&lt;ref name="reuters19880730"&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a name="Kosovo_and_the_breakup_of_Yugoslavia"></a><h4>Kosovo and the breakup of Yugoslavia</h4><p>Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, were mistreated by the Albanian majority and government&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ruza Petrovic| coauthor=Marina Blagojevic| title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija| url=http://www.rastko.org.yu/kosovo/istorija/kosovo_migrations/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Milosevic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.  In 1987, Serbian President Ivan StamboliÄ sent MiloÅ¡eviÄ to Kosovo to "pacify restive Serbs in Kosovo." On that trip, MiloÅ¡eviÄ broke away from a meeting with ethnic Albanians to mingle with angry Serbians in a suburb of Pristina. As the Serbs protested they were being pushed back by police with batons, MiloÅ¡eviÄ told them, "No one is allowed to beat you."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/kosovo/stories/past/milosevic/&lt;/ref&gt;  This incident was later seen as pivotal to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise to power.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}</p>

<p>In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations{{Fact|date=July 2007}} but was not recognized internationally. With an <em>80%</em> turnout, <em>98%</em> voted for Kosovo to be independent.</p>

One of the events that contributed to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise of power was the <em>Gazimestan Speech</em>, delivered in front of 100,000 Serb citizens at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a> on 28 June, 1989.

After the <a href='Dayton Agreement'>Dayton Agreement</a> in 1995, some Albanians organized into the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA), employing guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and civilians. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities were forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement led by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of <a href='Racak'>Racak</a>. The victims had been executed by Serb forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1812847.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at <a href='Rambouillet'>Rambouillet</a>. After more than a month of negotations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has been argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).</p>
<p>This triggered a 78-day <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> campaign in <a href='1999'>1999</a>. At first limited to military targets in Kosovo proper, the bombing campaign was soon extended to cover targets all over Yugoslavia, including bridges, power stations, factories, broadcasting stations, post offices, hospitals, civil buildings, trains, and various government buildings.</p>

During the conflict roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo, several thousand were killed (the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed). An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict. Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Non-combatant Albanian women experienced many atrocities during Kosovo war. It is believed some 20,000 Albanian women were raped by Serbian army, police and paramilitaries during the Kosovo war, but since rapes are associated with shame, many women after reporting this to different international humanitarian organizations have kept it secret. Some of the raped women have committed suicide after the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,194119,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vajzat.com/eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>During the Kosovo War, Serb combatants also engaged in a deliberate campaign of cultural destruction and rampage. According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated. The report concludes that most mosques were deliberately set on fire with no sign of fighting around the area. Among numerous other things, the following important objects were destroyed because they represented Albanian as well as Muslim and Catholic cultures:</p>
<p>Sinan Pasha Mosque in Prizren, the Prizren League Museum, the Hadum Mosque complex in Äakovica; the historic bazaars in Äakovica and PeÄ (Albanian: Peja); the Roman Catholic church of St. Anthony in Äakovica; and two old Ottoman bridges, Ura e Terzive (Terzijski most) and Ura e Tabakeve (Tabacki most), near Äakovica.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/kosovo/herscherriedlmayer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Kosovo which established the <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister.  Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year).  UNMIK oversaw the establishment of a professional, multi-ethnic Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>  
In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War.  The <a href='2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004'>2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004</a> was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots.  Kosovo Albanians mobs burned hundreds of Serbian houses, Serbian Orthodox Church sites (including some medieval churches and monasteries) and UN facilities. Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending. International prosecutors and judges handled the most sensitive cases.&lt;ref&gt;U.S State Department Report, published in 2007&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>
<p>  
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>.  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>15</a> ", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>16</a> ", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.

<a name="Kosovo_status_process"></a><h3>Kosovo status process</h3><p>{{Current|date=April 2007}}
{{main|Kosovo status process}}
{{seealso|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
A UN-led political process began in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status.  Belgrade has proposed that Kosovo be highly autonomous and remain a part of Serbia â Belgrade officials have repeatedly said that an imposition of Kosovo's independence would be a violation of Serbia's sovereignty and therefore contrary to international law. Pristina asserts that Kosovo should become independent, arguing that the violence of the Milosevic years has made continued union between Kosovo and Serbia not viable.  The <a href='Public International Law &amp; Policy Group'>Public International Law &amp; Policy Group</a> (PILPG) has counseled the government and political leadership of Kosovo during the final status negotiations.</p>
<p> 
UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, former <a href='president of Finland'>president of Finland</a>, leads the status process; <a href='Austria'>Austrian</a> diplomat Albert Rohan is his deputy.  Ahtisaari's office â the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) â is located in <a href='Vienna'>Vienna</a> and includes liaison staff from <a href='NATO'>NATO</a>, the <a href='European Union|EU'>European Union|EU</a> and the United States.</p>
<p>  
On <a href='February 2'>February 2</a>, <a href='2007'>2007</a>, UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari delivered to Belgrade and Pristina leaders a draft status settlement proposal.  The proposal covered a wide range of issues related to Kosovo's future, in particular measures to protect Kosovo's non-Albanian communities such as decentralization of government, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional protections for non-Albanian communities.  While not mentioning the word "independence," the draft included several provisions that were widely interpreted as implying statehood for Kosovo.  In particular, the draft Settlement would give Kosovo the right to apply for membership in international organizations, create a Kosovo Security Force and adopt national symbols.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070202/ts_afp/serbiakosovounstatusproposal_070202162726;_ylt=Ap9g4N..BOD23p6b5WY2sqsXxHcA;_ylu=X3oDMTBiMW04NW9mBHNlYwMlJVRPUCUl UN envoy seeks multi-ethnic, self-governing Kosovo'>17</a> ", <em>Agence France-Presse</em> (AFP), Vienna, February 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahtisaari conducted several weeks of consultations with the parties in Vienna to finalize the Settlement, including a high-level meeting on March 10 that brought together the Presidents and Prime Ministers of both sides.  After this meeting, leaders from both sides signaled a total unwillingness to compromise on their central demands (Pristina for Kosovo's independence; Belgrade for sovereignty over Kosovo). Concluding that there was no chance for the two sides to reconcile their positions, Ahtisaari said he would submit to the UN Security Council his own proposed status arrangements, including an explicit recommendation for the status outcome itself, by the end of March.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070310/wl_nm/serbia_kosovo1_dc_4;_ylt=AvL5xEUliSVd9RrxZLjpSI8XxHcA

<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
