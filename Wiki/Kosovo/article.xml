      <text xml:space="preserve">NO SUCH THING AS &quot;KOSOVA&quot; ONLY &quot;KOSOVO&quot; YOU IGNORANT BAFOONS. YOU CANNOT CHANGE A THOUSAND YEAR OLD NAME INTO SOMETHING THAT SUITS A MAJORITY WHO HAVE NO HISTIRICAL TIES TO THE PROVINCE. HISTORY CANNOT BE CHANGED THATS WHY WE HAVE ENCYCLOPAEDIAS SO DONT INSERT FALSE PORPAGANDA INFORMATION INTO SUCH ENCYCLOPAEDIAS!!!</text>
