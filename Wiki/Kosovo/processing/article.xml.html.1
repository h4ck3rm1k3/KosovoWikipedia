<p>]The Ottoman conquest of Kosovo was a major achievement for the Turks, as the Kosovar rich minerals would prove a great asset to their empire[&lt;]!-- citation needed --[&gt;]. The Turkish achievement in those years was not merely a military one. Whatever the glory of the medieval Balkan principalities may have been before the tragedy of Kosovo, conditions of order had already begun to break down in the Balkans before the Turks ever came. The coming of the Turks, for the savagery of the onslaught, was not an unmitigated tragedy. In the first centuries of Turkish rule, conditions of public order markedly improved.[ &lt;]ref[&gt;]http:\/\/cgi.stanford.edu\/group\/wais\/cgi-bin\/index.php?p=2059[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;]The establishment of Ottoman institutions in Kosovo brought about a new era. Religiously-selective taxation (see[ <a href='Jizya'>]Jizya[<\/a>]), education of the Kosovar aristocracy in Ottoman schools (see[ <a href='Enderun School'>]Enderun School[<\/a>]) and the stability brought to the region led to a mass conversion of the Christian population into[ <a href='Islam'>]Islam[<\/a>]. The truth is that the Turks were largely indifferent in the matters of religion, although, fearing that the religions of their subjects might serve as focal points of resistance, they forbade the building of all but the meanest churches, and likewise outlawed the ringing of church bells.Thus, the new religion was embraced by approximately two-thirds of the Albanians and a portion of the Slavs..[][<\/p>
<p>]During the 19th century, Kosovo was a typical redoubt of defiant people who fought against the Ottoman regime in quest for their national liberty. As a result, many Albanian highlanders retained some autonomy and were allowed to apply their customary law (mainly the[ <a href='Kanun|Kanun of LekÃ« Dukagjini'>]Kanun|Kanun of LekÃ« Dukagjini[<\/a>]). Nevertheless, examples of Ottoman attempts to give an end to this practice are abundant; the heroine Nora of the Kelmendi clan earned a distinguished place in Kosovar history by assassinating the Ottoman leader in Kosovo.[&lt;]ref[&gt;]Ferid Duka, "Lufta Ã§lirimtare kundÃ«r sundimit osman (shek.

<p>]During the Ottoman period, nonetheless, there was recorded a great amount of endeavors to promote the Albanian language and culture. The Catholic cleric who authored the earliest known Albanian book,[ <a href='Gjon Buzuku'>]Gjon Buzuku[<\/a>], is believed to have been of Kosovar origin. Moreover, the Catholic bishop,[ <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>]PjetÃ«r Bogdani[<\/a>], a native of Kosovo, published his classic[ <em>]Band of the Prophets[<\/em> ]in 1686, and later headed the anti-Ottoman movement. His engagement in the national cause culminated in 1689, when he raised a 20,000-member army comprised of Christian and Muslim Albanians, who joined the Austrians in their war against Turkey. The campaign resulted in a brief liberation of Kosovo, but after a plague breakout among Austrians and Kosovars, the Turks soon recovered all their lost areas. Bogdani himself died in December 1689, while his remains were inhumanely exhumed by Turks and Tatars and fed to dogs.[&lt;]ref[&gt; <a href='http:\/\/www.albanianliterature.net\/authors1\/AA1-01.html PjetÃ«r Bogdani, biography by R.

]In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the[ <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>]History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia[<\/a> ]itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory. Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the 1876â1877 Serbo-Turkish war and the 1877â1878 Russo-Turkish war are now known as '[<a href='muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher'>]muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher[<\/a>]' (which means 'refugee', from[ <a href='Arabic'>]Arabic[<\/a> <a href='muhajir'>]muhajir[<\/a>]). Their descendants still have the same surname,[ <em>]Muhaxheri[<\/em>]. It is estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the[ <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>]Vilayet of Kosovo[<\/a> ]between 1876 and 1912 by Turks and their Albanian allies, especially during the[ <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War'>]Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War[<\/a> ]in 1897.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}.[][<\/p>
<p>]In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of PriÅ¡tina and[ <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>]Kosovska Mitrovica[<\/a> ]under civil Serbian control,[  ]and outside the jurisdiction of the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a response, the Albanians formed the nationalistic and conservative[ <a href='League of Prizren'>]League of Prizren[<\/a> ]in[ <a href='Prizren'>]Prizren[<\/a> ]later the same year. Over three hundred Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a[ <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>]Greater Albania|unified Albanian people[<\/a> ]under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure on the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army began fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well. By the end of the 19th century the[ <a href='Albanians'>]Albanians[<\/a> ]replaced the[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]as the dominant people in Kosovo..[][<\/p>
<p>]In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decree that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians.

]{{Politics of Kosovo}}[
]In 1999,[ <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>]United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244[<\/a> ]placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted the[ <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>]United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo[<\/a> ](UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment..[][<\/p>
<p>]In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's[ <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>]Provisional Institutions of Self-Government[<\/a> ](PISG). The PISG replaced the[ <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>]Joint Interim Administrative Structure[<\/a> ](JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service..[][<\/p>
<p>]According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo..[][<\/p>
<p>]The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to MiloÅ¡evic's rule. The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006. The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj. Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora." Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly..[][<\/p>
<p>]In November 2001, the[ <a href='OSCE'>]OSCE[<\/a> ]supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly. After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected[ <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>]Ibrahim Rugova[<\/a> ]as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister..[][<\/p>
<p>]After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in[ <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>]Ramush Haradinaj[<\/a> ](AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption..[][<\/p>

]Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005. He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK). But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander[ <a href='Agim Ceku'>]Agim Ceku[<\/a>]. Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs. The Kosovo Assembly elected[ <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>]Fatmir Sejdiu[<\/a>], a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.[&lt;]ref[&gt;]"[<a href='http:\/\/www.adnki.com\/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>]10[<\/a> ]", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;&lt;]ref[&gt;]"[<a href='http:\/\/www.reliefweb.int\/rw\/RWB.NSF\/db900SID\/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>]11[<\/a> ]", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.[&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.
