During the Islamisation many Churches and Holy Orthodox Christian places were raised to the ground or turned in to Mosques. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren was teared down at the end of the 16th century and the material used to build the Mosque of Sinan-pasha, an Islamized Serb, in Prizren. Although the[ <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>]Serbian Orthodox Church[<\/a> ]was officially abolished in 1532, an Islamized Serb from Bosnia, Vizier[ <a href='Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ'>]Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ[<\/a> ]influenced the restoration of the[ <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>]Patriarchate of PeÄ[<\/a> ]in 1557.

Western Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting against Albanians. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri).

Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution.

]Soon afterwards, as approved by the Assembly in 1990, the autonomy of Kosovo and Metohija was revoked back to the old status.

In the early nineties, Albanians organized a parallel state system which managed the non-violent resistance movement and organized a parallel system of education and healthcare, among other things. With the events in[ <a href='Bosnia'>]Bosnia[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Croatia'>]Croatia[<\/a> ]coming to an end, the Serb government started relocating Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo.

This triggered a 78-day[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a> ]campaign in[ <a href='1999'>]1999[<\/a>]. During the conflict, some 12,000 Kosovars were killed, of whom 9,000-10,000 were[ <a href='Albanians'>]Albanians[<\/a> ]and 1,000-2,000 others ([<a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Roma'>]Roma[<\/a>]) and up to 700,000 Albanians and over 100,000 Serbs expelled. Some 3,000 Albanians are still missing. The number of Serbian soldier, policemen, and civilian deaths is considered to be around 3,000, but it's also disputed to be much more, as 2,800 people of Serb origin are still missing, believed dead. According to OSCE numbers and Kosovar Albanian sources on population size and distribution, an estimated[ <em>]45.7%[<\/em> ]of the Albanian population and[ <em>]59.5%[<\/em> ]of the Serb population had fled Kosovo during the bombings (i.e. from 23 March to 9 June 1999)..[][<\/p>
<p>]With the arrival of NATO, a large number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 100,000 by the UNHCR. Around 120,000 remain in Kosovo and oppose any rule by Albanians.
