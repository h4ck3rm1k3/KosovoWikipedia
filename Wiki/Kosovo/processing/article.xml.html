<a name="Ancient"></a><h3>Ancient</h3><p>The region of Kosovo is believed to have been inhabited by <a href='Illyrians|Illyrian tribes'>Illyrians|Illyrian tribes</a> since the <a href='Bronze Age'>Bronze Age</a>. In ancient times, the area was known as <a href='Dardania (Europe)|Dardania'>Dardania (Europe)|Dardania</a> and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The south of Kosovo was ruled by <a href='Macedon|Macedonia'>Macedon|Macedonia</a> since <a href='Alexander the Great'>Alexander the Great</a>'s reign in the 4th century BC. The local <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a> were of <a href='Illyrian'>Illyrian</a> or <a href='Thracian'>Thracian</a> stock. Illyrians resisted rule by the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading imperial powers, the region was eventually occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a> in 28 BC and became part of the Roman province of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a>. After <a href='85|AD 85'>85|AD 85</a> it was part of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a> Superior. Emperor <a href='Diocletian'>Diocletian</a> later c. <a href='284'>284</a> made Dardania into separate province with its capital at Naissus (<a href='NiÅ¡'>NiÅ¡</a>). When the Roman Empire split in <a href='Anno Domini|A.D.'>Anno Domini|A.D.</a> <a href='395'>395</a>, the area of Kosovo came under the <a href='Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire'>Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire</a>, the <a href='Byzantine Empire'>Byzantine Empire</a>. Many inhabitants of <a href='Dardania'>Dardania</a> became leaders in Rome and <a href='Constantinopolis'>Constantinopolis</a>, including <a href='Justinian the Great'>Justinian the Great</a>.</p>
<a name="Medieval"></a><h3>Medieval</h3><a name="Great_Migrations_and_Interregnums"></a><h4>Great Migrations and Interregnums</h4><p><a href='Slavic peoples|Slavs'>Slavic peoples|Slavs</a> came to the territories that now form modern Kosovo in the <a href='6th century|6th'>6th century|6th</a>-<a href='7th century|7th centuries'>7th century|7th centuries</a>, with the largest influx of migrants in the 630s. The Slavs were <a href='Christianization|Christianized'>Christianization|Christianized</a> in several waves between the <a href='7th century|7th'>7th century|7th</a> and <a href='9th century'>9th century</a>, with the last wave taking place between <a href='867'>867</a> and <a href='874'>874</a>. The northwestern part of Kosovo, <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, became a part of the Byzantine <a href='Serb'>Serb</a> vassal state the <a href='Principality of Rascia'>Principality of Rascia</a>, with <a href='Desnik|Dostinik'>Desnik|Dostinik</a> as the principality's capital.</p>
<p>In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire|Czardom of the Bulgarians'>First Bulgarian Empire|Czardom of the Bulgarians</a>. Although <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> restored control over <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> throughout the 10th century, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire after the Bulgarian Empire crumbled in the late 900s. In a <a href='Slavic'>Slavic</a> rebellion led <a href='Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria'>Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria</a>, the whole of Kosovo came under the control of the renewed <a href='First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Czardom'>First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Czardom</a> from the late 10th century, until the Byzantine restoration of 1018. In 1040-1041, Slavs staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantines restored control.</p>
<p> 
Throughout the following decades, numerous foreign peoples invading the Byzantine Empire stormed Kosovo, among them the <a href='Cumans'>Cumans</a>.</p>
<p> 
In 1072, local Slavs under George Voiteh pushed a final attempt to restore Imperial Bulgarian power and invited the last heir of the <a href='House of Comitopuli'>House of Comitopuli</a> - <a href='Duklja'>Duklja</a>'s prince <a href='Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin'>Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin</a> of the <a href='House of Vojislavljevic'>House of Vojislavljevic</a>, son of the <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Mihailo Voislav'>Mihailo Voislav</a> - to assume power. The Serbs decided to conquer the entire Byzantine region of Bulgaria. King Mihailo dispatched his son with 300 elite Serb fighters led by Duke Petrilo. Constantine Bodin was crowned in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> as <em>Petar III</em> <a href='List of rulers of Bulgaria|Czar of the Bulgarians'>List of rulers of Bulgaria|Czar of the Bulgarians</a> by Goerge Voiteh and the Slavic Boyars. The Empire swept across Byzantine territories in months, until the significant losses on the south had forced Czar Petar to withdraw. In 1073, the Byzantine forces chased Constantine Bodin, defeated his army at <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> and imprisoned him.</p>
<a name="Serbian_takeover"></a><h4>Serbian takeover</h4><p>The full Serbian takeover was carried out under a branch of the <a href='House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav'>House of VojislavljeviÄ|House of Voislav</a> <a href='Grand Prince'>Grand Princes</a> of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a>. In <a href='1093'>1093</a>, Prince Vukan advanced on <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The Byzantine Emperor himself came to <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a> for negotiations. ZveÄan served as the Byzantine line-of-defence against constant invasions from the neighboring Serbs. A peace agreement was made, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. Vukan's armies stormed Kosovo. In <a href='1094'>1094</a>, <a href='Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius'>Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius</a> attempted to renew peace negotiations in Ulpiana. A new peace agreement was concluded and Vukan handed over hostages to the Emperor, including his two nephews UroÅ¡ and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the conflict in <a href='1106'>1106</a>, once again defeating John Comnenus' army. However, his death halted the total Serb conquest of Kosovo.</p>
<p>In <a href='1166'>1166</a>, a Serbian nobleman from <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a>, <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>Stefan Nemanja</a>, the founder of the <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja</a> ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a>. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the <a href='Sitnica'>Sitnica</a> river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in <a href='1183'>1183</a>, Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the <a href='Hungarians'>Hungarians</a> after the death of <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>Manuel I Comnenus</a> in <a href='1180'>1180</a>, marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo.</p>
<p>Nemanja's son, <a href='Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II'>Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stefan II</a>, recorded that the border of the Serbian realm reached the river of Lab. Grand Prince Stephen II completed the inclusion of the Kosovo territories under Serb rule in 1208, by which time he had conquered Prizren and Lipljan, and moved the border of territory under his control to the Å ar mountain.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_the_Serbs"></a><h4>Kingdom of the Serbs</h4><p>In <a href='1217'>1217</a>, the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom'>History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom</a> achieved recognition. In <a href='1219'>1219</a>, an autocephalous <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was created, with <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, Prizren and Lipljan being the Orthodox Christian <a href='Episcopates'>Episcopates</a> on Kosovo. By the end of the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, the centre of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church</a> was moved to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> from <a href='Å½iÄa'>Å½iÄa</a>.</p>
<p>In the 13th century, Kosovo becomes the heart of the Serbian political and religious life, with the Å ar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was in Pauni. On an island was <a href='SvrÄin'>SvrÄin</a>, and on the coast <a href='Å timlji'>Å timlji</a>, and in the mountains was the Castle of <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating, and as the rulers' living quarters. After 1291, the Tartars broke all the way to PeÄ. <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a> managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the <a href='Mother of Christ'>Mother of Christ</a> of LjeviÅ¡ka in Prizren around 1307, which became the seat of the Prizren Episcopric, and the magnificent <a href='GraÄanica'>GraÄanica</a> in 1335, the seat of the Lipljan Episcopric. In 1331, Juvenille King DuÅ¡an attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in Nerodimlje. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of <a href='PetriÄ'>PetriÄ</a>, but DuÅ¡an captured him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palailogos and their children in ZveÄan, where the dethroned King died on <a href='11 November'>11 November</a> <a href='1331'>1331</a>.</p>
<p>In 1327 and 1328, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani started forming the vast DeÄani domain, although, Serbian King DuÅ¡an would finish it in 1335. Stefan of Dechani issued the Dechani Charter in 1330, listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne.</p>
<a name="Serbian_Empire_and_Despotate"></a><h4>Serbian Empire and Despotate</h4><p><a href='Monarch|King'>Monarch|King</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archaengel near Prizren in <a href='1342'>1342</a>-<a href='1352'>1352</a>. The Kingdom was transformed into an <a href='Serbian Empire|Empire'>Serbian Empire|Empire</a> in 1345 and officially in 1346. Stefan DuÅ¡an received <a href='John VI Cantacuzenus'>John VI Cantacuzenus</a> in <a href='1342'>1342</a> in his Castle in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In <a href='1346'>1346</a>, the Serbian <a href='Archbishopric|Archepiscopric'>Archbishopric|Archepiscopric</a> at PeÄ was upgraded into a <a href='Patriarchate'>Patriarchate</a>, but it was not recognized before <a href='1370'>1370</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the Empire fell into disarray prior to DuÅ¡an's death in <a href='1355'>1355</a>, feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar <a href='Stefan UroÅ¡ V'>Stefan UroÅ¡ V</a>. Kosovo became a domain of the <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ</a>, but Prince Voislav VoinoviÄ expanded his demesne further into Kosovo. The armies of King <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ</a> from <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a> and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in <a href='1369'>1369</a>, putting a halt to his advances. After the <a href='Battle of Marica'>Battle of Marica</a> on <a href='26 September'>26 September</a> <a href='1371'>1371</a>, in which the MrnjavÄeviÄ brothers lost their lives, <a href='House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ'>House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ</a> of <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a> took Prizren and PeÄ in <a href='1372'>1372</a>. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the <a href='Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ'>Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> invaded and met the Christian coalition under <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> on <a href='28 June'>28 June</a> <a href='1389'>1389</a>, near <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a>, at Gazi Mestan. The Serbian Army was assisted by various allies. The epic <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the Ottomans had 140,000. Through the cunning of <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a>, <a href='Sultan'>Sultan</a> <a href='Murad I|Murad'>Murad I|Murad</a> was murdered and the new Sultan <a href='Beyazid'>Beyazid</a> had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> and <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> were canonised by the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> for their efforts in the battle. The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by the Albanian ruler Gjergj Kastrioti <a href='Skanderbeg'>Skanderbeg</a> on one side, and Ottoman troops supported by the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄs</a> in <a href='1448'>1448</a>. Skanderbeg's troops that were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the BrankoviÄ's troops, who was more or less a Turkish <a href='Vassal'>Vassal</a>. Hungarian King <a href='John Hunyadi'>John Hunyadi</a> lost the battle after a 2-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the Ottoman Empire, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in 1459.</p>
<p> 
In 1455, new castles rose to prominence in <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a> and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, centres of the Ottoman vassalaged House of BrankoviÄ.</p>
<a name="Ottoman_rule"></a><h3>Ottoman rule</h3><p>{{main|Viyalet of Kosovo}}
The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> brought <a href='Islamisation'>Islamisation</a> with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the <a href='Viyalet of Kosovo'>Viyalet of Kosovo</a> as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. This brought a great shift, as the Orthodox Serb population began to lose its majority when masses of <a href='Turkic peoples|Turks'>Turkic peoples|Turks</a> and <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> (<a href='Muslims'>Muslims</a>) moved to Kosovo. During the Islamisation, many Churches and Holy Orthodox Christian places were razed to the ground or turned in to Mosques. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren was torn down at the end of the 16th century and the material used to build the Mosque of Sinan-pasha, an Islamized Serb, in Prizren. Although the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was officially abolished in 1532, an Islamized Serb from Bosnia, Vizier <a href='Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ'>Mehmed-pasha SokoloviÄ</a> influenced the restoration of the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> in 1557. Special privileges were provided, which helped the survival of Serbs and other Christians in Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of <a href='1683'>1683</a> - <a href='1699'>1699</a> with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a <a href='Catholic Archibishop'>Catholic Archibishop</a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion. In <a href='1690'>1690</a>, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a>, who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the Ottomans. The people that followed him were mostly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> â 20,000 Serbs abandoned <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> alone - but they were likely followed by other ethnic groups. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the <a href='18th century'>18th century</a>. It is also noted that some <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> adopted <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>, while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanianians, adopting their culture and even language. By the end of the 19th century, <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> replaced the Serbs as the dominating nation of Kosovo.</p>

<a name="Modern"></a><h3>Modern</h3><p>In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren. The possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed at the meeting, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory, much easier than elsewhere.</p>

Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the <a href='1876'>1876</a>-<a href='1877'>1877</a> Serbo-Turkish war and the <a href='1877'>1877</a>-<a href='1878'>1878</a> Russo-Turkish are now known as '<a href='muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher'>muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher</a>' (which means 'refugee', from <a href='Arabic'>Arabic</a> <a href='muhajir'>muhajir</a>) and are the ancestors of many who are still known by their same surnames, <em>Muhaxheri</em>. It is also estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> between <a href='1876'>1876</a> and <a href='1912'>1912</a>, especially during the <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War'>Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War</a> in <a href='1897'>1897</a>.</p>

In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that gave the cities of <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a> and <a href='Mitrovica'>Mitrovica</a> under civil Serbian control, outside the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a responce, the Albanians formed the nationalistic &amp; conservative <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> later the same year. Over 300 Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>Greater Albania|unified Albanian people</a> under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1898 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well{{citation needed}}.</p>
<p> 
In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decrete that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularely the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a> and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However at that time Serbs have consisted about <em>40%</em> of the whole Vilayt of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo.</p>

Numerous colonist Serb families moved-in to Kosovo, equalizing the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs. Many Albanians fled into the mountains and numerious Albanian and Turkish houses were raized. The reconquest of Kosovo was noted as a vengance for the 1389 <a href='Battle of Kossovo'>Battle of Kossovo</a>.

Refreshed and regrouped, it decided to return to the battlefield. In 1918 the Serbian Army pushed the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a> out of Kosovo. During their liberation of Kosovo, the Serbian Army committed atrocities against the population in revenge. Serbian Kosovo was unified with Montengrin as Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia. After the World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians'>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians</a> <em>("MbretÃ«ria Serbe,Kroate,Sllovene" in Albanian, " "Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca" in Serbo-Croatian)</em> on <strong>1st december 1918</strong>, gathering territories gained in victory.</p>
<a name="Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_and_WWII"></a><h4>Kingdom of Yugoslavia and WWII</h4><p>The 1918-1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a raise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In the Kingdom Kosovo was split onto four counties - three being a part of the entity of Serbia: ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since <a href='26 April'>26 April</a> <a href='1922'>1922</a> split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>. In 1921 the Albanian elite lodged an official protest of the government to the League of Nations, claiming that 12,000 Albanians had been killed and over 22,000 imprisoned since 1918 and seeking a <a href='Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands'>Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands</a>. The League of Nations did not respond, as the appeal was found unfounded. As a result, an armed <em>Kachak</em> resistance movement was formed whose main goal was to unite Albanian-populated areas of the Kingdom to Albania.</p>

Tens of thousands of Serbs lost their lives and around 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the war.

Prior to the surrender of <a href='History of Italy|Fascist Italy'>History of Italy|Fascist Italy</a> in <a href='1943'>1943</a>, the German forces took over direct control of the region.

<a name="Kosovo_in_the_Second_Yugoslavia"></a><h4>Kosovo in the Second Yugoslavia</h4><p>The Province of Kosovo was formed in 1945 as an autonomous region to protect its regional <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> majority within the <a href='History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia'>History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia</a> as a member of the <a href='SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia'>SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia</a> under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, <a href='Josip Broz Tito'>Josip Broz Tito</a>, but with no factual autonomy.

In the <a href='1974'>1974</a> constitution, the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Region within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. <a href='Serbo-Croatian'>Serbo-Croatian</a> and <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> were defined as official languages on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Serbs and Albanians. In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. The ethnic balance of Kosovo witnessed unproportional increase as the number of <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> tripled gradually rising from almost <em>65%</em> to over <em>80%</em>, but the number of <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> barely increased and dropped in the full share of the total population from some <em>25%</em> down to <em>10%</em>.</p>
<p>Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities" &lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Serbs and Yugoslav state authorities resulting in increased emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups &lt;ref name="reuters19860527"&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="csm19860728"&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"&lt;/ref&gt;.

<p>In <a href='1986'>1986</a>, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a>, a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering of ethnic strives and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>1</a>.

<p>By the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and <a href='Vojvodina'>Vojvodina</a> &lt;ref name="reuters19880730"&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"&lt;/ref&gt;.</p>

One of the events that contributed to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise of power was the <em>Gazimestan Speech</em>, delivered in front of 100,000 Serb citizens at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a> on 28 June, 1989. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkanpeace.org/cib/kam/kams/kams19.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, MiloÅ¡eviÄ criticised the "dramatical national divisions" and called Yugoslavia "a multinational community [which] can survive only under the conditions of full equality for all nations that live in it."</p>
<p> 
Soon afterwards, as approved by the Assembly in 1990, the autonomy of Kosovo was reduced. After <a href='Slovenia'>Slovenia</a>'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, MiloÅ¡eviÄ used the seat to attain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents.</p>
<p> 
Many Albanians organized a peaceful separatist movement. State institutions and elections were boycotted and separate Albanian schools and political institutions were established. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a>, <a href='1990'>1990</a> an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, this was not recognized by the Government or any foreign states. In September of that year, the unofficial parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of <a href='KaÃ§anik'>KaÃ§anik</a>, adopted the <em>Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo</em>. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organisations {{citation needed}} but was not recognized internationally. With an <em>80%</em> turnout, <em>98%</em> voted for Kosovo to be independent.</p>
<p>With the events in <a href='Bosnia'>Bosnia</a> and <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> coming to an end, the Serb government started relocating Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia all over Serbia, including in Kosovo. In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make room for the refugees{{citation needed}}.

After the <a href='Dayton'>Dayton</a> Agreement in 1995, some Albanians organized into the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA), employing guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and civilians. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities was forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement led by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of <a href='Racak'>Racak</a>. The victims had been executed by Serb forces &lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1812847.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. The so-called Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at <a href='Rambouillet'>Rambouillet</a>. After more than a month of negotations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has beeen argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).</p>
<p>This triggered a 78-day <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> campaign in <a href='1999'>1999</a>. At first limited to military targets in Kosovo proper, the bombing campaign was soon extended to cover targets all over Yugoslavia, including bridges, power stations, factories, broadcasting stations, post offices, and various government buildings.</p>
<p> 
During the conflict, several thousand were killed, the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed. An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict, including military personnel and civilians, primarily as a result of the ground war in Kosovo between the KLA and the Yugoslav military, Serbian police and Serbian paramilitary forces. Some 3000 people are still missing,of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm&lt;/ref&gt;. According to OSCE numbers and Kosovar Albanian sources on population size and distribution, an estimated <em>45.7%</em> of the Albanian population and <em>59.5%</em> of the Serb population had fled Kosovo during the bombings (i.e. from 23 March to 9 June 1999).</p>
<p> 
With the arrival of NATO, a large number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 100,000 by the UNHCR. Around 120,000 remain in Kosovo. Many Serbs fear to return to their homes since they perceive not to be safe for them, even with <a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a> protection, notably the <a href='2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004'>2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004</a>, when 900 Serbian houses were burned and other property destroyed{{citation needed}} while the Serbian populace was closed into enclaves and had to concentrate to the north of Kosovo until today, causing a wave of 3,500 Serbian refugees.</p>

In total, more than 30 Orthodox Serb Churches and Monasteries were destroyed during the March unrest in Kosovo. Many of the Churches and Monasteries were dating back to the 12th, 13th and 14th century. At the end of the two-day riots, 19 people were dead, 11 Albanians and 8 Serbs.</p>
<p>During the Kosovo War, Serbs also engaged in a deliberate campaign of cultural destruction and rampage. According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated. The report concludes that most mosques were deliberately set on fire with no sign of fighting around the area. Among numerous other things, the following important objects were destroyed because they represented Albanian as well as Muslim and Catholic cultures:</p>
<p>Sinan Pasha Mosque in Prizren, the Prizren League Museum, the Hadum Mosque complex in Gjakova (Serbian: Djakovica); the historic bazaars in Gjakova and Pec (Albanian: Peja); the Roman Catholic church of St. Anthony in Gjakova; and two old Ottoman bridges, Ura e Terzive (Terzijski most) and Ura e Tabakeve (Tabacki most), near Gjakova.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/kosovo/herscherriedlmayer.htm&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>88%</em> <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> (between 1,584,000 and 1,733,600)</li>

Others give much higher figures for Roma and Turks &lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/news/1999/03/31newsa.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serbianunity.net/news/world_articles/Dragnich1098.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
