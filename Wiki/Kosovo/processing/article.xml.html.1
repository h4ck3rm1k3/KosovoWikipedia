<a name="Demographics"><\/a><h2>]Demographics.[][<\/h2><p><a href='Albanians'>]Albanians[<\/a> ]now comprise an nearly 90% majority of the population of the province. Their percentage as a proportion of the province's population has increased steadily over time as a result of a high birth rate, Albanian immigration and non-Albanian emigration. Most of the province's population became refugees during the war but most of the Albanian refugees quickly returned to their homes at its end. In the aftermath of the conflict, several hundred thousand non-Albanians, especially[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Roma (people)|Romas'>]Roma (people)|Romas[<\/a>], fled the province to escape renewed intercommunal violence. The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall in recent years due to a combination of economic hardship and ethnic tension..[][<\/p>
