      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;b&gt;Kosovo&lt;/b&gt; is a region in the Balkans with a ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian}} majority population. Its international status is anomalous in that although it is formally a province of the Republic of [[Serbia]] under the sovereignty of [[Yugoslavia]], actual administration is presently conducted by the [[United Nations]] with no involvement on the part of the Serbian or Yugoslav governments.



Kosovo's anomalous status is the result of the [[Kosovo War]] of March-June [[1999]], in the course of which air strikes against Serbia and its armed forces by members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] secured the withdrawal of Serbia's military and the province's occupation by a NATO-led international force (KFOR) including [[Russia]]n troops. 



Kosovo became a part of the revived kingdom of Serbia during the First [[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] of 1912-1913. Created an autonomous province in 1946, the region enjoyed almost complete self-government under predominantly Albanian local communist party leaders from 1974 until 1989, when its autonomy was revoked by a more nationalistic Serbian government following allegations of repression against the Serb minority. 



Albanian opposition to Serbian sovereignty, which had surfaced in March 1981 rioting in the capital [[Prishtina]], subsequently took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the &quot;Kosovo Liberation Army&quot; (Ushtria Clirimtare e Kosoves, or UCK). Guerrilla attacks and Serbian military action reduced the province by 1998 to a state of internal war, occasioning western intervention amid allegations of Serbian reprisals against Albanian civilians.
