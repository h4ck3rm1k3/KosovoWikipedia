      <text xml:space="preserve">the Crnac mine. During the lead-zinc-silver exploitation at Farbani Potok (Artana-Novo Brdo), about 3 Mt of high-grade [[halloysite]] was discovered. Halloysite is an aluminosilicate clay mineral used as a raw material for [[porcelain]] and [[bone china]]. This is only one of five known exploitable deposits of this very high-value (US$140-450/t) clay, the other four being in New Zealand, Turkey, China and Utah, US. Current world production is estimated at 150,000 t/y. There is also [[nickel]] to be found in Kosovo and the largest working mine is in Çikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica. There are significant deposits of [[chromium]], [[bauxite]] and [[magnesite]], but mining has been stalled since 1999.

=== Unemployment ===

Major issue in Kosovo that is undermining Kosovo's development is unemployment. Official unemployment rate stands at 40%. [[The World Bank]] says that even with 6 per cent annual growth (twice what Kosovo manages at the moment), it would take ten years to cut unemployment by half, from 40 to 20 per cent. Persistent unemployment, in particular among the young, will fuel frustration, which would be bad for political peace.[http://centreforeuropeanreform.blogspot.com/2008/02/kosovo-economic-dilemma.html] Unemployment rate among young people age under 25, which contribute to app 50% of Kosovo's population, is much bigger and it stands app at 60%. But, Kosovo has youngest population in Europe, so in coming years, with significant development of educational sector on Kosovo, this fact could be overturned in Kosovo's favour.

==Administrative regions==
Kosovo, for administrative reasons, is considered as consisting of seven districts.
[[North Kosovo]] maintains its own government, infrastructure and institutions by its dominant ethnic [[Serb]] population in the [[District of Kosovska Mitrovica]], viz. in the [[Leposavić]], [[Zvečan]] and [[Zubin Potok]] municipalities and the northern part of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]].

[[Image:Kosovo ethnic 2005.png|thumb|220px|Ethnic composition of Kosovo in 2005 according to the [[OSCE]]]]
According to the Kosovo in Figures 2005 Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo in figures 2005 |author=UNMIK |publisher=Ministry of Public Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |author=BBC News |date=23/12/05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=Regions and territories: Kosovo |author=BBC News |date=20/11/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2 million in the following ethnic proportions:

* 92% [[Albanians]]
* 4% [[Serbs]]
* 2% [[Bosniaks]] and [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorans]]
* 1% [[Roma people|Roma]]
* 1% [[Turkish people|Turks]]

===Ethnic and cultural diversity===
[[Islam]] (mostly [[Sunni]], with a [[Bektashi]] minority) is the predominant [[religion]], professed by most of the majority ethnic Albanian population, the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities, and some of the Roma/[[Ashkali]]/[[Egyptians (Balkans)|Egyptian]] community. The Serb population, estimated at 100,000 to 120,000 persons, is largely [[Serbian Orthodox]]. Approximately 3 percent of ethnic Albanians are [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1 |title=Religion in Kosovo |author=International Crisis Group |date=31/01/01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90198.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2007 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71405.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2006 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia and Montenegro (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the largest population growth in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml Albanian Population Growth]&lt;/ref&gt; The people’s growth rate in Kosovo is 1.3%. Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew 4.6 times. If growth continues at such a pace, based on some estimations, the population will be 4.5 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosova-Hotels, Prishtinë]&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Demographics_of_Kosovo#World_War_II-1968|1948]] to [[Demographics_of_Kosovo#1989-1999:_Centralized_Yugoslav_Control|1991]] period, Serb population on Kosovo incresed for 12% (3 times less than in Serbia), while Albanian population increased for 300% in the same time period.

==Society==
===Cinema and media===
{{main|Music of Kosovo}}
Although in Kosovo the music is diverse, authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. Albanian music is characterized by the use of the ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''. [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at [[universities]] (at the [[University of Priština#Albanian university|University of Priština Faculty of Arts]]  and the [[University of Priština#Serbian university|University of Priština at Kosovska Mitrovica]]

===Sports===
{{main|Olympic Committee of Kosovo|Football Federation of Kosovo|Basketball Federation of Kosovo|Handball Federation of Kosovo|Table Tennis Federation of Kosovo}}
Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 &quot;Law on Sport&quot; passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo|Olympic Committee]], regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for sports clubs. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.
