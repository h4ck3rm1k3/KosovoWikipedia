<p> 
The province is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the <a href='Yugoslavia|Yugoslav'>Yugoslavia|Yugoslav</a>) government and Kosovo's largely ethnic-Albanian population. International negotiations began in <a href='2006'>2006</a> to determine the final status of Kosovo (<em>See <a href='Kosovo status process'>Kosovo status process</a></em>).</p>

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>
<p>  
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>.  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>2</a> ", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>3</a> ", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.

<a name="Kosovo_status_process"></a><h3>Kosovo status process</h3><p>{{main|Kosovo status process}}
{{seealso|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under <a href='UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> which ended the <a href='Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict'>Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict</a> of 1999. Whilst Serbia's continued sovereignty over Kosovo is recognised by the international community, a clear majority of the province's population would prefer independence.</p>
<p> 
The <a href='UN'>UN</a>-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock'>4</a> ", <em>BBC News</em>, October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 a draft resolution, backed by the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, the <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a>, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on <a href='20 July'>20 July</a> <a href='2007'>2007</a>, having failed to secure Russian backing. Kosovo Albanian leaders have reacted by proposing unilateral independence for <a href='28 November'>28 November</a> <a href='2007'>2007</a>, though the UN would be required to overrule any such action.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Kosovo | Kosovo pushes independence after UN action fails | accessdate=2007-07-20&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is feared in Kosovo should Kosovo Albanian demands for independence not be met.</p>
<a name="Health"></a><h2>Health</h2><p>Access to health care is free for all residents of Kosovo. Currently there is no health insurance, however, the Ministry of Health is in the process is preparing a legislative infrastructure, which is scheduled to be implemented in 2008.</p>

<p>Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in <a href='Gross Domestic Product'>Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. <a href='Inflation'>Inflation</a> is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
