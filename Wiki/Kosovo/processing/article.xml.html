Dardania was well-known for its gold resources and ancient writings describe the Dardani as fine producers of jewels. Major cities included Damastion, Naissus (<a href='Nis'>Nis</a>), Scupi (<a href='Skopje'>Skopje</a>), and Ulpiana.&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://www.shqiperia.com/kat/m/shfaqart/aid/71.html Historia e ShqipÃ«risÃ«, âMbretÃ«ria e DardanisÃ«: Territori dhe popullsia,â Shqiperia.com'>4</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> 
Dardania was conquered by Rome in the late 1st century B.C. and gave the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> some of its most outstanding emperors, including <a href='Constantine the Great'>Constantine the Great</a>. Christianity was spread in the country in its initial phases, while individuals like <a href='Nicetas of Remesiana|Niketas Dardani'>Nicetas of Remesiana|Niketas Dardani</a>, authored the early Christian hymnals.</p>
<p>With the <a href='Migration Period|Barbaric Invasion'>Migration Period|Barbaric Invasion</a> between the 5th and 8th century, Dardania became a safe haven for the preservation of the Illyrian culture and language as well as the heritage of the Romanized population.  Between the 9th and 11th century, Dardania was snatched from the <a href='Byzantine Empire'>Byzantine Empire</a> by the <a href='Bulgarian Empire'>Bulgarian Empire</a>. Later it was briefly returned to the Byzantines, before the <a href='Serbia'>Serbian</a> invasion in the late 12th century. In the next 100 years, the Serbs established their rule over Dardania, imposing a heavy burden in the Western Christian population, whose identity was threatened by the Serbian state-church. During this time, the seat of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was moved to <a href='Peja'>Peja</a>,&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, <em>Kosovo: A Short History</em> (UP: New York, 2003) 50.&lt;/ref&gt; while the natural resources allowed for a further expansion of the Serbian state. With the creation of a Serbian empire in the 14th century, Dardania became a central geographical unit of the Serbian state. This fact and the presence of the Serbian Orthodox church in the region has given rise to a romantic vision in Serbian culture regarding Kosovo as the âcradle of the Serbian civilization.â{{fact|date=February 2008}}
In 1389, in the famous <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> a coalition of Christian armies including Albanians, Bosnians and Hungarians, led by the Serbian prince <a href='Lazar Hrebljanovic'>Lazar Hrebljanovic</a> was defeated by the <a href='Ottoman Turks'>Ottoman Turks</a>, who finally took control of the territory in <a href='1455'>1455</a>.

The Ottoman conquest of Kosovo was a major achievement for the Turks, as the Kosovar rich minerals would prove a great asset to their empire. The establishment of Ottoman institutions in Kosova brought about a new era. The Catholic population was in a constant state of disfavor with the new regime, while the Orthodox Church had been placed under the protection of Ottoman monarchs. This status of the Roman Catholic Church led to a systematic oppression of its members. Likewise, heavy religiously-selective taxation and threats to national assimilation by forceful absorption into the Serbian Orthodox Church led to a mass conversion of Christian Albanians into <a href='Islam'>Islam</a>. The new religion was embraced by approximately two-thirds of the Albanians, while it slightly improved their status by preserving their national identity before the Serbian peril, it did not rule out the struggle against the Ottoman regime.</p>
<p>Kosovo was an ordinary sight of defiant people who fought against the new regime in quest for their national liberty. As a result, many Albanian highlanders retained some autonomy and were allowed to apply their customary law (mainly the <a href='Kanun|Kanun of LekÃ« Dukagjini'>Kanun|Kanun of LekÃ« Dukagjini</a>). Nevertheless, examples of Ottoman attempts to give an end to this practice are abundant; the heroine Nora of the Kelmendi clan earned a distinguished place in Kosovar history by assassinating the Ottoman leader in Kosovo.</p>
<p>During the Ottoman period, nonetheless, there was recorded a great amount of endeavors to promote the Albanian language and culture. The Catholic cleric who authored the earliest known Albanian book, <a href='Gjon Buzuku'>Gjon Buzuku</a>, is believed to have been born in Kosovo. Moreover, the Catholic bishop, <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>, a native of Kosovo, published his classic <em>Band of the Prophets</em> in 1686, and later headed the anti-Ottoman movement. His engagement in the national cause culminated in 1689, when he raised a 20,000-member army comprised of Christian and Muslim Albanians, who joined the Austrians in their war against Turkey. The campaign resulted in a brief liberation of Kosovo, but after a plague breakout among Austrians and Kosovars, the Turks soon recovered all their lost areas. Bogdani himself died in December 1689, while his remains were inhumanely exhumed by Turks and Tatars and fed to dogs.&lt;ref&gt; <a href='http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors1/AA1-01.html PjetÃ«r Bogdani, biography by R. Elsie, <em>Albanian Literature</em>'>5</a>&lt;/ref&gt; The loss had a negative impact on the wellbeing all inhabitants of Kosovo, whose liberation was not realized in an 18th-century Austrian endeavor either.</p>
<a name="Modern_era"></a><h3>Modern era</h3><p>In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory. Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the 1876â1877 Serbo-Turkish war and the 1877â1878 Russo-Turkish war are now known as '<a href='muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher'>muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher</a>' (which means 'refugee', from <a href='Arabic'>Arabic</a> <a href='muhajir'>muhajir</a>). Their descendants still have the same surname, <em>Muhaxheri</em>. It is estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> between 1876 and 1912 by Turks and their Albanian allies, especially during the <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War'>Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War</a> in 1897.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}</p>
<p>In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of PriÅ¡tina and <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>Kosovska Mitrovica</a> under civil Serbian control,  and outside the jurisdiction of the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a response, the Albanians formed the nationalistic and conservative <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> later the same year. Over three hundred Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a <a href='Greater Albania|unified Albanian people'>Greater Albania|unified Albanian people</a> under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure on the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army began fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well. By the end of the 19th century the <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> replaced the <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> as the dominant people in Kosovo.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}</p>
<p>In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decree that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from PriÅ¡tina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However, at that time Serbs have consisted about 25% of the whole Vilayet of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian rule along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}</p>

<p>Tito pursued a policy of weakening Serbia, as he believed that a "Weak Serbia equals a strong Yugoslavia". In the <a href='1974'>1974</a> constitution, the <a href='Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo'>Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo</a>'s government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia.

<p> 
In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition as a Republic within the Yugoslav Federation, while extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. &lt;!-- Tito's regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. What does this mean? --&gt; The ethnic balance of Kosovo tilted as the number of <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> tripled, rising from almost 75% to over 90%, but the number of <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> barely increased, dropping from 15% to 8% of the total population. Even though Kosovo was the least developed area of the former Yugoslavia, the living and economic prospects and freedoms were far greater than under the totalitarian <a href='Enver Hoxha|Hoxha'>Enver Hoxha|Hoxha</a> regime in Albania.</p>
<p>Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities"&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government.

<p>In <a href='1986'>1986</a>, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a>, a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>7</a>.

<p>MiloÅ¡eviÄ was initially sent to meet with local Communist party officials. However a large demonstration of Serbian nationalists had been organized to coincide with MiloÅ¡eviÄ's arrival.  When the demonstrators broke thru the police cordon the police got out their batons and the situation began to get ugly. At this point MiloÅ¡eviÄ went to a window and in an emotional moment promised the local Serbs that "No one is allowed to beat you." This newsbite was then seen on evening news and catapulted a then unknown MiloÅ¡eviÄ to the forefront of the current debate about the problems on Kosovo. Afterwards he agreed to listen to representatives of the Serbs who aired their grievances - this continued to the next morning. &lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare. Ed Jasminka UdoviÄka and James Ridgeway p82&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In order to save his skin, MiloÅ¡eviÄ fought back and established a political <a href='coup d'Ã©tat'>coup d'Ã©tat</a>. He gained effective leadership and control of the Serbian Communist party and pressed forward with the one issue that had catapulted him to the forefront of the political limelight, which was Kosovo. Thus, by the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and <a href='Vojvodina'>Vojvodina</a>.&lt;ref name="reuters19880730"&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<a name="Kosovo_and_the_breakup_of_Yugoslavia"></a><h4>Kosovo and the breakup of Yugoslavia</h4><p>Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, complained about mistreatment from the Albanian majority.  MiloÅ¡evic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.  In 1987, Serbian President Ivan StamboliÄ sent MiloÅ¡eviÄ to Kosovo to "pacify restive Serbs in Kosovo." On that trip, MiloÅ¡eviÄ broke away from a meeting with ethnic Albanians to mingle with angry Serbians in a suburb of Pristina. As the Serbs protested they were being pushed back by police with batons, MiloÅ¡eviÄ told them, "No one is allowed to beat you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/kosovo/stories/past/milosevic/ |title=Wily Milosevic makes the most of the worst |author=CNN |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was later seen as pivotal to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise to power.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}</p>

<p>In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations but was not recognized internationally. With an <em>80%</em> turnout, <em>98%</em> voted for Kosovo to be independent.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}</p>

<p>One of the events that contributed to MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise of power was the <em>Gazimestan Speech</em>, delivered in front of 100,000 Serb citizens at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a> on 28 June, 1989.

With the events in <a href='Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia'>Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia</a> and <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> coming to an end, the Serb government started relocating Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia all over Serbia, including in Kosovo.

<p>After the <a href='Dayton Agreement'>Dayton Agreement</a> in 1995, some Albanians organized into the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA), employing guerrilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities were forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement devised by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. 
On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of <a href='Racak'>Racak</a>. The victims had been executed by Serb forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1812847.stm |title=Racak massacre haunts Milosevic trial |author=Jon Silverman |date=14/02/02 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm |title=Yugoslav Government War Crimes in Racak |author=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the German newspaper "Berliner Zeitung," Finnish pathologist Helena Ranta, who was assigned by the EU as the head of the team sent to investigate the Racak incident "...expressed lack of comprehension regarding the work of the UN's Hague tribunal in the case of the so-called massacre of Racak." Ranta also criticized that "...Indications of serious fighting between Serbian soldiers and Albanian fighters on the night of 15th to 16th of January, 1999, in the Racak area had been inadequately pursued."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosovo.net/erpkiminfo_jan04/erpkiminfo19jan04.html |title="Racak case" in public focus again |author=KiM Info-Service |date=19/01/04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at <a href='Rambouillet'>Rambouillet</a>. After more than a month of negotiations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has been argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).</p>
<p>This triggered a 78-day <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> campaign in <a href='1999'>1999</a>.

During the conflict roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo, several thousand were killed (the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed). An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict. Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/781310.stm |title=3,000 missing in Kosovo |author=KiM Info-Service |date=07/06/00}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>During the Kosovo War, Serbs also engaged in a deliberate campaign of cultural destruction and rampage. According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated. The report concludes that most mosques were deliberately set on fire with no sign of fighting around the area. Among numerous other things, the following important objects were destroyed because they represented Albanian as well as Muslim and Catholic cultures:</p>

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under <a href='UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a>.  The <a href='UN'>UN</a>-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock'>17</a> ", <em>BBC News</em>, October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> 
In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, the <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a>, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29/06/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date=09/07/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=30/03/07 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG). The PISG replaced the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to MiloÅ¡evic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>Ramush Haradinaj</a> (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>

Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander <a href='Agim Ceku'>Agim Ceku</a>.  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a>, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death.

<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint.
