<p>During the <a href='Neolithic'>Neolithic</a> period, the region of Kosovo lay within the extent of the <a href='VinÄa-TurdaÅ culture'>VinÄa-TurdaÅ culture</a>. In the 4th to 3rd centuries BC, it was the territory of the <a href='Thraco-Illyrian'>Thraco-Illyrian</a> tribe of the <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a>. The territory of present-day Kosovo was conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and made the Roman province of <a href='Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum'>Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum</a> in 59 BC. The Kosovo region became part of <a href='Moesia Superior'>Moesia Superior</a> in AD 87. The "<a href='Slavic migrations'>Slavic migrations</a>" reached the Balkans in the 6th to 7th century, whereby autochthonous peoples merged with the northern newcomers. Kosovo was absorbed into the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire</a> in the 850s, where Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018. As the center of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, it often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> conquered it by the end of the 11th century. Fully absorbed into the Serbian Kingdom until the end of the 12th, it became the secular and spiritual centre of the <a href='History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state'>History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state</a> of the <a href='House of NemanjiÄ|NemanjiÄ'>House of NemanjiÄ|NemanjiÄ</a> dynasty in the 13th century, with the Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church in <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a>, while <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> was the secular center. The zenith was reached with the formation of a <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a> in 1346, which after 1371 transformed from a centralized absolutist medieval monarchy to a feudal realm. Kosovo became the hereditary land of the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ</a> and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a> and <a href='PriÅ¡tina|Pristina'>PriÅ¡tina|Pristina</a> flourished.</p>
<p>In the 1389 <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>, Ottoman forces defeated a coalition led by the Prince <a href='Lazar HrebeljanoviÄ'>Lazar HrebeljanoviÄ</a>.
In 1402, a <a href='Serbian Despotate'>Serbian Despotate</a> was raised and Kosovo became its richest territory, famous for mines.
The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in 1439.

<p>Kosovo, like the rest of Serbia, was occupied by the Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683â1699.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/habsbott16831699.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following the invitation from <a href='Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor'>Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>,&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/00000384/01/Todorovicweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in 1690, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a> led 37,000 predominantly <a href='Serbs|Serbian families'>Serbs|Serbian families</a> out of Kosovo into <a href='Habsburg Empire|Austria'>Habsburg Empire|Austria</a>. More migrations of Orthodox Christians from the Kosovo area continued throughout the 18th century during the <a href='Great Serb Migrations'>Great Serb Migrations</a>.
In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of Christians in Kosovo deteriorated, including full imposition of <a href='jizya'>jizya</a> (taxation of non-Muslims). In contrast, many Albanian chiefs converted to Islam and gained prominent positions in the Turkish regimen.&lt;ref name="hupchik"&gt;The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism. Dennis Hupchik&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, "Albanians had little cause of unrest" and "if anything, grew important in Ottoman internal affairs."&lt;ref name="hupchik"/&gt; The final result of four and a half centuries of Muslim rule was a marked decline in the previously dominant Slavic Christian demographic element in Kosovo, replaced by a Turko-Albanian&lt;ref&gt;Kosovo.Catholic Encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt; stratum.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, there was a "<a href='Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening'>Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening</a>" of <a href='ethnic nationalism'>ethnic nationalism</a> throughout the Balkans. The ethnic <a href='Albanian nationalism'>Albanian nationalism</a> movement was centered in Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 1871, a Serbian meeting was held in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of "Old Serbia" was discussed, as the <a href='History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia</a> itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory. In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of Pristina and <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>Kosovska Mitrovica</a> under civil Serbian control, and outside Ottoman jurisdiction, while the rest of Kosovo remained under Ottoman control. In the same year ethnic Albanians formed the <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a>, pursuing political aspirations of unifying the Albanian people and seeking autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. The League of Prizren ruled Kosovo until 1881, when it was quashed by Ottoman troops.</p>

<a name="Balkan_Wars_to_World_War_II"></a><h4>Balkan Wars to World War II</h4><p>The <a href='Young Turk'>Young Turk</a> movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albania'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from Pristina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June 1911.
In 1912, during the <a href='Balkan Wars'>Balkan Wars</a>, most of Kosovo was captured by the <a href='History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia'>History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia</a>, while the region of <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> ({{lang-sq|Dukagjini Valley}}) was taken by the <a href='History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro'>History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro</a>. An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. The Serbian authorities planned a colonization of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt; <a href='http://www.elsie.de/pdf/B2002GatheringClouds.pdf Elsie, R. (ed.)

ISBN 9951-05-016-6&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous colonist Serb families moved into Kosovo, equalizing the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs.
Kosovo's status within Serbia was finalized the following year at the <a href='Treaty of London'>Treaty of London</a>.&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos145.htm Treaty of London, 1913'>6</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In the winter of 1915-1916, during <a href='World War I'>World War I</a>, Kosovo saw a large exodus of the Serbian army which became known as the <em>Great Serbian Retreat</em>, as Kosovo was occupied by <a href='Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians'>Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians</a> and <a href='Austro-Hungarians'>Austro-Hungarians</a>.
In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the <a href='Central Powers'>Central Powers</a> out of Kosovo. After World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians'>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians</a> on 1 December 1918.</p>
<p>Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia (ZveÄan, Kosovo and southern Metohija) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> and <a href='Zeta'>Zeta</a>. In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the <a href='Kingdom of Yugoslavia'>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> and the territories of Kosovo were reorganized among the <a href='Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta'>Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta</a>, the <a href='Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava'>Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava</a> and the <a href='Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar'>Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar</a>.</p>
<p>In order to change the ethnic composition of Kosovo, between 1912-1941 a large-scale Serbian re-colonization of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied, as they weren't officially designated as a minority.

<p>The province first took shape with its present borders in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area. Prior to world War II, no entity by the name of Kosovo had existed where-as in the <a href='Ottoman Empire'>Ottoman Empire</a> (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a <em>vilayet</em> with its borders having been revised on several occasions.

<p>The violent oppression and forced expatriation of Albanians resumed, particularly after 1953, when <a href='Josip Broz Tito'>Josip Broz Tito</a> reached an agreement with Turkish Foreign Minister <a href='Mehmet Fuat KÃ¶prÃ¼lÃ¼'>Mehmet Fuat KÃ¶prÃ¼lÃ¼</a> to push Yugoslavian Albanians to declare themselves Turks and leave for Turkey.&lt;ref name="daskalovski"/&gt;</p>

In February 1970 the <a href='University of Prishtina'>University of Prishtina</a> was opened, providing higher education in Albanian.&lt;ref name="hdk"/&gt; In the 1974 constitution, the <a href='Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo'>Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo</a>'s government received more powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia.

Due to very high birth rates, the number of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents of alleged harassment from their Albanian neighbors. While there was tension, charges of "genocide" and planned harassments have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example in 1986 ""<a href='http://books.google.com/books?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=genocide+false+kosovo&amp;sig=kmSTVjt9oW2TpXi7kUVw81mjN7o the Serbian Orthodox Church published an official, though false, claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'Genocide''>7</a>.

In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no official role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG). The PISG replaced the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>However, since 1999, the Serb-inhabited areas of Kosovo, such as <a href='North Kosovo'>North Kosovo</a> have remained <em>de facto</em> independent from the Albanian-dominated government in <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a>.

<p>In February 2003, the Serb areas united to form the Union of Serbian Districts and District Units of Kosovo and Metohija in a meeting in Kosovska Mitrovica, which has since served as the <em>de facto</em> "capital." The Union's President is <a href='Dragan VeliÄ'>Dragan VeliÄ</a>. There is also a central governing body, the Serbian National Council for Kosovo and Metohija (SNV).

<p>Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in <a href='Gross Domestic Product'>Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. <a href='Inflation'>Inflation</a> is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP.

<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 |title=May finds Kosovo with 50% unemployed |author=eciks |date= 2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

<p>The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm |title=Brussels offers first Kosovo loan |author=BBC News |date= 2005-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a "zero tolerance" approach.</p>
<p>Kosovo has a reported foreign debt of 1,264&amp;nbsp;billion USD that is currently serviced by Serbia.</p>
