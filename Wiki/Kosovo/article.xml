      <text xml:space="preserve">Kosova (Albanian), Kosovo i Metohija and Kosmet (Serbo-Croatian), (2002 est. pop. 1,900,000), 4,126 sq mi (10,686 sq km). Prishtina is the capital city. The largely mountainous region includes the fertile valleys and is drained by tributaries of the Morava and Drini rivers. Agriculture, stock raising, forestry, and mining are the major occupations. Kosovo's population before 1999 was about 80% Albanian; ethnic Albanians now make up about 88% of the inhabitants. Settled by the Slavs in the 7th cent., the region passed to Bulgaria in the 9th cent. and to Serbia in the 12th cent. From 1389 to 1913, it was under Turkish rule. Partitioned in 1913 between Serbia and Montenegro, it was incorporated into Yugoslavia after World War I. Following World War II, Kosovo became an autonomous region within Serbia. In 1990, demands for greater autonomy were rebuffed by Serbia, which rescinded its autonomous status. Albanians were repressed and Serbian migration into the region encouraged; in response Albanians pressed for Kosovo's complete independence.</text>
