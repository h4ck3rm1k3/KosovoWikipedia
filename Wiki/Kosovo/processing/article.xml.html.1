It is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute between Serbia and the province's majority ethnic[ <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>]Albanians|Albanian[<\/a> ]population. Between 1996 and 1999, the Serbian Army attempted to purge the region of ethnic Albanians under the auspices of "ethnic cleansing", met by the resistance of the KLA (Kosovar Liberation Army) and in 1999, international intervention from[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a>].[  ]Since the conclusion of the[ <a href='Kosovo War'>]Kosovo War[<\/a>], the region has been administered by the[ <a href='United Nations'>]United Nations[<\/a> ]Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo ([<a href='UNMIK'>]UNMIK[<\/a>]).

]just don't put lies here anymore.[

]Contact me if you need some history lessons.[][<\/p>
<a name="Disputes_over_language,_culture_and_citizenship"><\/a><h2>]Disputes over language, culture and citizenship.[][<\/h2><p>]The province is most widely known as 'Kosovo' and this has become the standard in international and United Nations usage. In[ <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>]Albanian language|Albanian[<\/a> ]this name becomes 'Kosova', which is more often found within Kosovo and in official use by the Provisional Institutions, though both Albanian and[ <a href='Serbian language|Serbian'>]Serbian language|Serbian[<\/a> ]are official languages. Wherever political and cultural sensitivity are particularly important, the international community will use 'Kosovo\/Kosova' to describe the province and adopt a similar standard for many place names. While the formal title 'Republic of Kosova' has fallen out of use with the integration of Kosovo Albanian politics into the UNMIK system, the formal Serbian title 'Kosovo i Metohija' remains in colloquial and official use in parts of Kosovo and in Serbia proper, where parallel institutions for Kosovo remain until final status is resolved..[][<\/p>
<p>]The question of what to call the inhabitants of Kosovo collectively has also aroused debate. The two words accepted by the[ <a href='Oxford English Dictionary'>]Oxford English Dictionary[<\/a> ]are "Kosovar" (borrowed from Albanian), the most widely used variant in English, by far, and "Kosovan" (using the English rules for[ <a href='demonym'>]demonyms[<\/a>]) much less used. As Kosovo has no formal[ <a href='state'>]statehood[<\/a>], current international usage is to refer to Kosovo[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]and Kosovo[ <a href='Albanians'>]Albanians[<\/a>]. Most of the Albanian-descended community in Kosovo would prefer the use of Kosovar or Kosovan because of the attendant political overtones, while the Serb minority continue to think of themselves as Serb or Serbian (from Kosovo)..[][<\/p>
<p>]As for language and citizenship, so for cultural and political symbols. The province has never had an official flag of its own. The[ <a href='Flag of Albania|Albanian flag'>]Flag of Albania|Albanian flag[<\/a> ]is used unofficially by the Kosovo Albanian-dominated administration and the vast majority of Kosovo Albanians; although recently the[ <a href=':Image:Kosovo Presidential Flag.gif|flag of the presidency'>]:Image:Kosovo Presidential Flag.gif|flag of the presidency[<\/a> ]is being used as an unofficial flag of Kosovo, as could be seen during[ <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>]Ibrahim Rugova[<\/a>]'s funeral[ <a href='http:\/\/sq.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ibrahim_Rugova'>]1[<\/a>]..[][<\/p>
<p>]The Serb-inhabited area of north Kosovo uses only the[ <a href='flag of Serbia'>]flag of Serbia[<\/a>], which is formally the flag of Serbia, although this usage is rejected by virtually all Kosovo Albanians, Croats, Turks, Goranis and other smaller minorities apart from Serbs and some Roma..[][<\/p>
<a name="Politics_and_international_status"><\/a><h2>]Politics and international status.[][<\/h2><p>]Kosovo's international status is anomalous. The administration is presently conducted by the[ <a href='United Nations'>]United Nations[<\/a> ]with little or no involvement on the part of the Serbian government (under Security Council resolution 1244 of[ <a href='10 June'>]10 June[<\/a> <a href='1999'>]1999[<\/a>]; see[ <a href='http:\/\/www.un.org\/Docs\/scres\/1999\/sc99.htm Security Council Resolutions 1999'>]2[<\/a>]).[  ]The government of the province is the responsibility of the[ <a href='United Nations Mission in Kosovo'>]United Nations Mission in Kosovo[<\/a> ](UNMIK). Under the terms of the[ <a href='Kumanovo agreement'>]Kumanovo agreement[<\/a> ]and subsequent UN[ <a href='Security Council'>]Security Council[<\/a> <a href='Resolution 1244'>]Resolution 1244[<\/a>], which ended the[ <a href='Kosovo War'>]Kosovo War[<\/a>], security is provided by the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which is led by[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a> ]and is answerable to UNMIK..[][<\/p>
<p>]{{Politics of Kosovo}}[
]UNMIK has so far established a provisional assembly, provisional government and the office of provisional president, which are legislative and executive bodies under UNMIK's control. Control of security, justice and external affairs are still under full UNMIK control. Elections for the[ <a href='Assembly of Kosovo'>]Assembly of Kosovo[<\/a> ]were held in November[ <a href='2001'>]2001[<\/a> ]and again in[ <a href='2004'>]2004[<\/a> ]and were qualified as the most democratic elections in the Balkans.[ <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>]Ibrahim Rugova[<\/a> ]was elected as president in March[ <a href='2002'>]2002[<\/a>]. The seat of the assembly, government and president is in[ <a href='Prishtina'>]Prishtina[<\/a>]\/[<a href='Pristina'>]Pristina[<\/a>]. So far, the parliament has enacted and UNMIK approved a constitutional framework, customs code, two criminal codes and some 200 laws..[][<\/p>
<p>]The Constitutional Framework enacted by the Kosovo Assembly (with UN Security Council approval) has adopted a policy of[ <a href='affirmative action'>]affirmative action[<\/a> ]in the assembly to ensure that the province's minorities are properly represented. Out of 120 seats, 10 are reserved for Serbs and another 10 for non-Albanian minorities, while the remaining 100 seats are elected through direct voting. UNMIK does not take account, though, the Serbs and other non-Albanians who have left Kosovo as a result of interethnic tension, many of whom are unable to reclaim lost property or safely to attend elections. The process of 'returns' of these displaced persons has yet to begin in earnest, as a result of insufficient funding and a perceived inability of the UN to control violence against minority groups, as well as a concern on the part of Kosovo Albanians that an increased number of Serbs will undermine the chances for an independent Kosovo..[][<\/p>
<p>]Kosovo is still recognised internationally as a part of former Yugoslavia. Its final status has not yet been resolved, (talks on the subject started on 20 February 2006), and considerable difficulties lie ahead in balancing the irreconcilable Kosovo Albanian, Kosovo Serb and Belgrade positions. The Kosovo Albanians reject Serbian sovereignty and demand secession from the country. On the other side, Serbia is opposed to yielding any of its territory, and domestic opinion, supported by the existence of a centuries-old written, material and architectural history, continues to see the province as the heartland of Serbian culture..[][<\/p>
<p>]The international community is becoming less and less reluctant to see Kosovo become independent, as last Contact Group and UN Security Council meetings showed. The[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a> ]countries insisted on the republican borders as the only acceptable solution during the wars in[ <a href='Croatia'>]Croatia[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Bosnia-Herzegovina'>]Bosnia-Herzegovina[<\/a> ]in the 1990s, but this does not rule out that they might revisit this in the case of Kosovo vis-Ã -vis Serbia and Montenegro. Questions have also been raised about whether an independent Kosovo would be politically or economically viable, given its small size, the state of its economy. The size of Kosovo is larger than several European countries(Vatican,Andorra,Monaco,Luxemburg,etc), thus it should not be the issue. But once status is resolved, and Kosovo has access to international monetary institutions the economic development will be possible. In early 2006, western diplomants have come out clearly in support of an independent Kosovo, with guarantees for the minorities..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]UNMIK is issuing travel documents which serve instead of[ <a href='passport'>]passports[<\/a> ]in countries which recognise them, and issues identity cards and car plates, which again are valid only in certain countries. UNMIK has created a police force (the[ <a href='Kosovo Police Service'>]Kosovo Police Service[<\/a>]) with employees from all ethnic communities (Albanian, Serbian, Roma, Bosniac, etc) and manages the province's railways and airline ([<a href='Kosova Airlines'>]Kosova Airlines[<\/a>]). The airspace of the province is controlled by KFOR..[][<\/p>
<p>]The European Union runs the Kosovo economy in cooperation with the Kosovo institutions. The EU has initiated the[ <a href='Stabilisation Tracking Mechanism'>]Stabilisation Tracking Mechanism[<\/a>], a special and separate track of EU integration for Kosovo..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]On[ <a href='January 21'>]January 21[<\/a>],[ <a href='2006'>]2006[<\/a>], the President of Kosovo, Dr.[<a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>]Ibrahim Rugova[<\/a>], died at age 61.[  ]On[ <a href='February 10'>]February 10[<\/a>], 2006,[ <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>]Fatmir Sejdiu[<\/a> ]was elected to be the second President by an 80-12 vote in parliament..[][<\/p>
<a name="Economy"><\/a><h2>]Economy.[][<\/h2><p><a href='UNMIK'>]UNMIK[<\/a> ]declared the[ <a href='euro'>]euro[<\/a> ]to be the official currency of the province in[ <a href='2001'>]2001[<\/a> ]in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the[ <a href='Deutschmark'>]Deutschmark[<\/a>], which had become the[ <em>]de facto[<\/em> ]currency even before the 1999 war. However, the[ <a href='Serbian dinar'>]Serbian dinar[<\/a> ]remains an official currency, used principally in the[ <a href='Kosovo Serb enclaves'>]Kosovo Serb enclaves[<\/a>]; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro; Kosovo's administration uses the euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the[ <a href='United States dollar'>]United States dollar[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Swiss franc'>]Swiss franc[<\/a> ]are the most widespread..[][<\/p>
<a name="Demographics"><\/a><h2>]Demographics.[][<\/h2><p>]Ethnic Albanians comprise almost 90% of the population of the province. In the aftermath of the conflict some one thousand non-Albanians, particularly[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Roma'>]Roma[<\/a> ]either followed Serb soldiers as they withdrew, were forcibly expelled by the Albanian majority or fled the province to escape perceived threats of revenge by Albanians(note:Most of Kosovo Serbs were in the ruling administration of Milosevic's dictatorship in Kosovo). The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall since the arrival of NATO and the UN as a result of violence, perceived intimidation, and economic hardship. Many still live in communal camps in[ <a href='Serbia'>]Serbia[<\/a> ]or[ <a href='Macedonia'>]Macedonia[<\/a> ]cared for by international relief agencies. However, there have been many attempts by Kosovo's government to resettle Non-Albanians in the region which have largely been successful, including the resettlement of well over one thousand Serbians and Roma from 2004 - 2005. The Kosovo government has been widely praised for paying for the rebuilding of Serb houses in the aftermath of the 2004 riots. This has been marked as the first case of reparations in the history of the Balkans..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo[<a href='http:\/\/www.sok-kosovo.org\/pdf\/population\/Kosovo_population.pdf'>]3[<\/a>], Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1,8 and 2,0 million in the following ethnic proportions:.[][<\/p>
