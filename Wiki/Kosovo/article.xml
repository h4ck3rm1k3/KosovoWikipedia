The conquests of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire brought the region into close contact with the [[Middle East]] and subsequently introduced [[Islam]] to the population. During the late 19th century, Kosovo was the centre of the Albanian national [[National awakening of Albania|awakening]]. In 1912, the Ottoman [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] was divided between [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], both of which became part of [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.

==History==
{{Main|History of Kosovo|20th century history of Kosovo}}

The formation of the Republic of Kosovo is a result of the turmoil of the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|disintegration of Yugoslavia]], particularly the [[Kosovo War]] of 1998 to 1999, but it is suffused with issues dating back to the [[rise of nationalism in the Balkans]] during the last part of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]] in the [[19th century]], [[National Renaissance of Albania|Albanian]] vs. [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian]] nationalisms in particular, the latter notably surrounding the [[Battle of Kosovo]] eponymous with the Kosovo region.

===Early history (before 1455)===
{{Main|Dardani|Illyrians|Battle of Kosovo|History of Medieval Serbia}}

From the 4th to 1st centuries BC, the [[Dardani]] inhabited the region which roughly corresponds to modern Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/I47/index.html |title=I/47 Illyrians (700 BC - 10 AD) |publisher=Fanaticus.org |date=2003-06-13 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was then conquered by Rome in the [[160s BC]], and incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87. The &quot;[[Slavic migrations]]&quot; reached the Balkans in the 6th to [[7th century]], whereby autochthonous peoples merged with the northern newcomers.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians. A Stipcevic. Noyes Press. Pg 76 ''the Slavs merged with these people (the Illyrians), thus preserving in their own identity remains of ancient Illyrians''&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo was absorbed into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 850s, where Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018. As the centre of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, it often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of [[Rascia]] conquered it by the end of the [[11th century]]. Such takeovers had little impact on the local populace, since it merely represented a changing of one Balkan Christian dynasty by another. The zenith of Serbian power was reached in 1346, with the formation of the [[Serbian Empire]]. When the Serbian Empire fragmented into a conglomeration of principalities in 1371, Kosovo became the hereditary land of the [[House of Branković]].

In the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo]], Ottoman forces defeated a coalition of Serbs, Albanians, and Bosnians &lt;ref name=&quot;prospect-magazine.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=4173 |title=Essays: 'The battle of Kosovo' by Noel Malcolm &amp;#124; Prospect Magazine May 1998 issue 30 |publisher=Prospect-magazine.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by the Prince [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar Hrebeljanović]]. Soon after parts of Serbia accepted Turkish vassalage and Lazar's daughter was married to the Sultan to seal peace.
By 1455, it was finally and fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/v/vickers-serb.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Kosovo (1455 to 1912)===
{{Main|History of Ottoman Kosovo}}
{{See|Vilayet of Kosovo|History of Ottoman Serbia}}

Kosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]''). During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sandžak]] region cutting into present-day [[Central Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kukës]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] with the city of [[Skopje]] (then Üsküp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day [[Republic of Macedonia]], including larger urban settlements such as [[Štip]] (''İştip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Republic of Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'') ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kosovo03.png see map]).

Kosovo, like Serbia, was occupied by the Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683–1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/habsbott16831699.html |title=WHKMLA : Habsburg-Ottoman War, 1683-1699 |publisher=Zum.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view of the [[Ottoman Empire]] is shaped by 19th century [[nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Latest activity 1 hour ago |url=http://www.amazon.com/Kosovo-Bradt-Travel-Guide-Warrander/dp/1841621994#reader |title=Kosovo (Bradt Travel Guide): Gail Warrander, Verena Knaus: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albanians]] see the Ottoman influence as largely positive, allowing for the expansion of Urban centres such as [[Vushtrri]] and [[Prizren]]. Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government, no fewer than 42 [[Grand Vizier]]s of the Empire were Albanian in origin, including Mehmet Afik (1873-1936) an Albanian from [[Predrag Stojaković|Peja]] who would write the [[Turkish National Anthem]] in 1921, &quot;Istiklal Marsi&quot; (The Independence March).&lt;ref&gt;Kosovo (Bradt [[Guide book|Travel Guide]]), by Gail Warrander (Author), Verena Knaus (Author), ISBN 1841621994; ISBN 978-1841621999, Publisher: Bradt Travel Guides; 1st edition (January 1, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Serb narratives see this period of Ottoman rule as a time of oppression.

Following the invitation from [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} in 1690, the [[Serbian Patriarch of Peć]] [[Arsenije III Čarnojević|Arsenije III]] claimed that he led some 30,000 to 40,000 predominantly [[Serbs]] out of Kosovo and other areas into [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;The Serbs. Sima Cirkovic. [[Blackwell Publishing]]. Pg 144 ''Patriarch Arsenije III claimed that 30,000 people followed him (on another occasion the figure was 40, 000)''&lt;/ref&gt; More migrations of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] from the Kosovo area preceded and followed throughout the 18th century during the [[Great Serb Migrations]].&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 115 ''The great migrations that had begun earlier continued after the establishment of Ottoman rule in territories that had formerly been part of the Serbian state''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the forcible removal of Christian subjects by the Turks as slaves and war booty.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 115 '' Prior to the final conquest, the Turks often took inhabitants as slaves, frequently to Asia Minor&lt;/ref&gt; In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Patriarchate of Peć]] and the position of Christians in Kosovo deteriorated, including full imposition of [[jizya]] (taxation of non-Muslims). In contrast, many Albanian chiefs converted to Islam and gained prominent positions in the Turkish regimen.&lt;ref name=&quot;hupchik&quot;&gt;The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism. Dennis Hupchik&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, &quot;Albanians had little cause of unrest&quot; and &quot;if anything, grew important in Ottoman internal affairs&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;hupchik&quot;/&gt; and sometimes persecuted Christians harshly on behalf of their Turkish masters.&lt;ref name=&quot;prospect-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The final result of four and a half centuries of Muslim rule was a marked decline in the previously dominant Slavic Christian demographic element in Kosovo. The cause of this demographic shift was manifold. The outward movement of Christians was accompanied by an inward migration of Albanians&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 ''In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the Islamisation of urban centres, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control.&lt;/ref&gt; and other Islamic peoples such as Circassians (with notable anti-Christian sentiments), who often served as auxiliary troops for the Turks.&lt;ref name=&quot;prospect-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt; In addition, during Ottoman rule, the distinction between Serb and Albanian was not always clear cut. As Islam became the dominant religion, some Serbs converted to Islam and lost their Serbian identity, and were rather referred to as &quot;Turks&quot; or &quot;[[Albanisation|Albanians]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 208-09, citing 19th century author Jakov Ignjatovic: ''A Serb without his religious rites and customs is not a Serb''&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century, there was a &quot;[[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening]]&quot; of [[ethnic nationalism]] throughout the Balkans. The ethnic [[National Renaissance of Albania|Albanian nationalism]] movement was centred in Kosovo. This, unfortunately, systemetised the underlying ethnic tensions into a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;prospect-magazine.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

In 1878 the '''League of Prizren''' ({{lang-sq|Lidhja e Prizrenit}}) was formed. This was a [[Political organisation|political organization]] which aimed to unify all the [[Albanians]] of the Ottoman Empire iny a common struggle for autonomy and greater [[cultural rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Kosovo What Everyone Needs to Know by Tim Judah Publisher [[Oxford University Press]] US, 2008 ISBN 0195376730, 9780195376739 page 36&lt;/ref&gt; Albanians generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire, albeit with greater rights afforded to their people.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 ''since Islamicised Albanians represented a significant portion of the Ottoman armed forces and administration, they did not give up the Empire easily''&lt;/ref&gt; The League was disestablished in 1881 but nevertheless enabled the awakening of a [[Nation|national identity]] amongst Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;George Gawlrych, The Crescent and the Eagle, (Palgrave/Macmilan, London, 2006), ISBN 1845112873&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
{{Main|20th century history of Kosovo}}
{{Very long|date=July 2009}}
====Balkan Wars====
{{Main|Balkan Wars}}
The [[Young Turk]] movement took control of the Ottoman Empire after coup in 1912 which disposed of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. The movement supported a centralised form of government and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by the various nationalities of the Ottoman Empire. An allegiance to '''Ottomanism''' was promoted instead.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Zurcher, Ottoman sources of Kemalist thought, (New York, Routledge, 2004), Page. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; An Albanian uprising in 1912 exposed the Empires Northern territories in Kosovo and [[Novi Pazar]] which led to an invasion by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. [[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] suffered a serious defeat at the hands of Albanians in 1912, culminating in the Ottoman loss of most of its Albanian inhabited lands. The Albanians threatened to march all the way to [[Salonika]] and reimpose [[Abdul Hamid (soldier)|Abdul Hamid]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, A short history of Kosovo, (London, 1998), Page. 248. &lt;/ref&gt; A wave of Albanians in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] ranks also deserted during this period, refusing to fight their own kin. Two months later in September of the same year, a joint Balkan force made up of Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Greek forces drove the Ottomans out of most its European possessions. The [[Member of Parliament|British MP]] Audrey Hebert sums up the impact of the Albanian revolt in brining an end to Ottoman rule in Europe; ‘In the end, like Samson in the Temple of Gaza, they pulled down the columns of the Ottoman Empire upon their own head. It was the Albanians and not the Serbs or Bulgars or Greeks who defeated the Turks’.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, Page. 249. &lt;/ref&gt;
The rise of Nationalism unfortunately hampered relations between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, due to influence from [[Russians]], [[Austrians]] and [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Isa Blumi, ''Rethinking the Late Ottoman Empire: A Comparative Social and Political History of Albania and Yemen, 1878-1918''
(Istanbul: The Isis Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; After the capture of Kosovo by [[Serbia]] in 1912, there were concerted Serbian colonisation efforts in Kosovo during various periods between Serbia's 1912 takeover of the province and [[WWII]]. So the population of Serbs in Kosovo fell after World War II, but it had increased considerably before then.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A short history of Kosovo'', (London, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. Serbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schabnel 2001 20&quot;&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur, Ramesh (eds). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, [[Collective action|Collective Action]], and International Citizenship. New York: The United Nations University, 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous colonist Serb families moved into Kosovo, equalising the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs.Kosovo's status within Serbia was finalised the following year at the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos145.htm Treaty of London, 1913].&lt;/ref&gt;

====First World War and birth of Kingdom of Yugoslavia====
In the winter of 1915–16, during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Austria–Hungary|Austria-Hungary]].
In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.

Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia (Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Rascia]] and [[Zeta]]. In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]].

In order to change the ethnic composition of Kosovo, between 1912 and 1941 a large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised [[Slavic peoples|Slavic nations]] of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as [[Constituent country|constituent nations]] of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schabnel 2001 20&quot; /&gt; Albanians and other Muslims were forced to emigrate, mainly with the [[land reform]] which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;daskalovski&quot;&gt;Daskalovski, Židas.

====Second World War====
In 1941, Kosovo and Yugoslavia became involved in [[World War II]] after the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia in 1941. Large parts of Kosovo became a part of [[Albania under Italy|Italian-controlled Albania]], other parts went to [[Tsardom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied [[Serbia (1941-1944)|Military Administration of Serbia]]. The Italian Fascist regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] with its expansionist and [[Irredentism|irredentist]] aims on both Albania and Yugoslavia exploited the nationalist sentiment amongst Albanians to gain favour of the Albanian population for the Italian-run protectorate which ruled Albania, and thus encouraged the establishment of a [[Greater Albania]] which included large portions of Kosovo which was achieved in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, tens of thousands of Serbs were driven out of Kosovo during the Second World War;&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht(ed); Thakur, Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; other sources claim that around 10,000 Serbs were killed and between 80,000 and 100,000 Serbs were expelled, while roughly the same number of Albanians from Albania were brought to settle in these lands.&lt;ref&gt;Krizman, Serge.

Maps of Yugoslavia at War, Washington, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mustafa Merlika-Kruja|Mustafa Kruja]], the Prime Minister of Albania, was in Kosovo in June 1942, and at a meeting with the Albanian leaders of Kosovo, he said: &quot;''We should endeavour to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo be – the area be cleansed of them and all Serbs who had been living there for centuries should be termed colonialists and sent to concentration camps in Albania. The Serb settlers should be killed.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanovic, Dimitrije. The Book on Kosovo. 1990.

At the 1944 wartime [[Bujan]] conference the Kosovar communist resistance leaders passed a resolution on the postwar assignment of Kosovo to Albania, but their opinion was later disregarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;malcolm&quot;/&gt; After numerous uprisings of [[Partisan (military)|Partisans]] led by [[Fadil Hoxha]], Kosovo was liberated after 1944 with the help of the Albanian partisans of the [[Comintern]] and became a province of [[Serbia]] within the [[Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

====Kosovo in Communist Yugoslavia====
{{Main|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946-1974)|Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo}}

The province first took shape with its present borders in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area. Prior to world War II, no entity by the name of Kosovo had existed where-as in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a ''[[vilayet]]'' with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to [[Albania]], or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]], or [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]] (including its previous capital, [[Skopje]]) with another part in the [[Sandžak]] region of [[Central Serbia]].

The violent oppression and forced expatriation of Albanians resumed, particularly after 1953, when [[Josip Broz Tito]] reached an agreement with Turkish [[Foreign minister|Foreign Minister]] [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü]] to push Yugoslavian Albanians to declare themselves Turks and leave for Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;daskalovski&quot;/&gt;

The harsh repressions and expatriations came to an end when the 4th Plenum of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] held at [[Brijuni]] (the ''Brioni Plenum'') in July 1966 ousted Yugoslavian [[Interior minister|Interior Minister]] and Vice President [[Aleksandar Ranković]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;&gt;[[Robert Elsie|Elsie, Robert]]. ''Historical Dictionary of Kosova''. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2004. ISBN 0810853094.&lt;/ref&gt; who was instrumental in the brutal treatment of Kosovar Albanians.&lt;ref name=&quot;daskalovski&quot;/&gt; In the late 1960s Kosovo gained limited internal autonomy. In February 1970 the [[University of Pristina]] was opened, providing [[higher education]] in Albanian.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;/&gt; In the 1974 constitution, the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]'s government received more powers, including the highest governmental titles – President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a ''de facto'' Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia (similar rights were extended to [[Vojvodina]]). In Kosovo [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] were defined as [[official language]]s on the provincial level. Due to very high [[birth rate]]s, the number of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents of alleged harassment from their Albanian neighbours. While there was tension, charges of &quot;genocide&quot; and planned harassments have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example in 1986 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'Genocide'&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=genocide+false+kosovo&amp;sig=kmSTVjt9oW2TpXi7kUVw81mjN7o |title=Religion and the creation of race ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though they were disproved by police statistics,&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; they received wide play in the Serbian press and that led to further ethnic problems and eventual removal of Kosovo's status. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia along with [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19810419&quot;&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, &quot;One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;/&gt; During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters19860527&quot;&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, &quot;Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;csm19860728&quot;&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, &quot;Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from [[Racism|ethnic discrimination]] and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19870627&quot;&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, &quot;Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s.
The 1986 [[SANU Memorandum|Memorandum of the Serbian Academy]] warned that Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate [[Economy|economic sectors]] and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): [http://archive.serbianunity.net/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum]. GIP Kultura. Belgrade.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1989, [[Slobodan Milošević]] delivered the [[Gazimestan speech]] in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. Many think that this speech helped Milošević consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, &quot;What's next for Slobodan Milošević?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political manoeuvring, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;&gt;Rogel, Carole.

====Kosovo War====
{{Main|Kosovo War}}
In 1995 the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the [[Bosnian War]], drawing considerable international attention. However, despite the hopes of Kosovar Albanians, the situation in Kosovo remained largely unaddressed by the [[international community]], and by 1996 the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), an ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] guerilla group, had prevailed over the [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent resistance]] movement and had started offering armed resistance to [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] security forces, resulting in early stages of the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rama, Shinasi A.

''The International Journal of Albanian Studies'', 1 (1998), pp. 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, as the violence had worsened and displaced scores of Albanians, Western interest had increased. The Serbian authorities were compelled to sign a [[ceasefire]] and partial retreat, monitored by [[OSCE]] observers according to an agreement negotiated by [[Richard Holbrooke]]. However, the ceasefire did not hold and fighting resumed in December 1998. The [[Račak massacre]] in January 1999 in particular brought new international attention to the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;/&gt; Within weeks, a multilateral international conference was convened and by March had prepared a draft agreement known as the [[Rambouillet Accords]], calling for restoration of Kosovo's autonomy and deployment of [[NATO]] [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeping forces]]. The [[Serbian Party|Serbian party]] found the terms unacceptable and refused to sign the draft.

During the conflict, roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo. Altogether, more than 11,000 deaths have been reported to [[Carla Del Ponte]] by her prosecutors.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/514828.stm |title=World: Europe UN gives figure for Kosovo dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 [[Romani people|Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/781310.stm |title=3,000 missing in Kosovo |author=KiM Info-Service |date= 2000-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately by June Milošević had agreed to a foreign military presence within Kosovo and withdrawal of his troops.

Since May 1999, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] has prosecuted crimes committed during the Kosovo War. Nine Serbian and Yugoslavian commanders have been indicted so far for [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] and violations of the [[Laws of war|laws or customs of war]] in Kosovo in 1999: Yugoslavian President [[Slobodan Milošević]], Serbian President [[Milan Milutinović]], Yugoslavian [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nikola Šainović]], Yugoslavian Chief of the General Staff Gen. [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]], Serbian Interior Minister [[Vlajko Stojiljković]], Gen. [[Nebojša Pavković]], Gen. ''Vladimir Lazarević'', Deputy Interior Minister of Serbia [[Vlastimir Đorđević]] and Chief of the Interior for Kosovo [[Sreten Lukić]]. Stojiljković killed himself while at large in 2002 and Milošević died in custody during the trial in 2006. No final judgement concerning the other defendants has been produced so far. The indictment against the nine has alleged that they directed, encouraged or supported a campaign of terror and violence directed at Kosovo Albanian civilians and aimed at the expulsion of a substantial portion of them from Kosovo. It has been alleged that about 800,000 Albanians were expelled as a result. In particular, in the last indictment as of June 2006, the accused were charged with murder of 919 identified Kosovo Albanian civilians aged from one to 93, both male and female.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/cis/en/cis_milosevic_slobodan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milutinovic/cis/en/cis_milutinovic_al_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/ind/en/dor-3rdai070119.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Six KLA commanders were indicted in two cases: [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Isak Musliu]] and [[Haradin Bala]],&lt;ref&gt;Another Albanian was indicted together with them, but the charges against him were promptly withdrawn after his arrest, as he turned out not to be the person referred to in the indictment.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ramush Haradinaj]], ''Idriz Balaj'' and ''Lahi Brahimaj''. They were charged with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in Kosovo in 1998, consisting in persecutions, cruel treatment, torture, murders and rape of several dozens of the local Serbs, Albanians and other civilians perceived unloyal to the KLA. In particular, Limaj, Musliu and Bala were accused of murder of 22 identified detainees at or near the Llapushnik [[Internment|Prison Camp]]. In 2005 Limaj and Musliu were found not guilty on all charges, Bala was found guilty of persecutions, cruel treatment, murders and rape and sentenced to 13 years. The appeal chamber affirmed the judgements in 2007. In 2008 Ramush Haradinaj and Idriz Balaj were acquitted, whereas Lahi Brahimaj was found guilty of cruel treatment and torture and sentenced to six years. Notices of appeal are currently being considered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/cis/en/cis_limaj_et_al.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/haradinaj/cis/en/cis_haradinaj_al_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/ind/en/lim-2ai040212e.htm |title=Second Amended Indictment - Limaj et al |publisher=Icty.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 1999, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration ([[UNMIK]]) and authorised [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the [[territorial integrity]] of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1999&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=RESOLUTION 1244 (1999) |date=1999-06-17 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |accessdate=2008-02-19 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 200,000-280,000, representing the majority of the Serb population, left when the Serbian forces left.

Around 120,000-150,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, but are subject to ongoing harassment and discrimination due to physical threats for their safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]]. The UN-backed talks, led by UN [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] &quot;, ''BBC News'', October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|UN Security Council Resolution]] which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the [[Security Council]], was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date= 2007-07-10 |accessdate= 2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=2007-03-30 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a &quot;[[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]]&quot; consisting of negotiators from the [[European Union]] ([[Wolfgang Ischinger]]), the United States ([[Frank Wisner]]) and [[Russia]] (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Despite Russian disapproval, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France appeared likely to recognise Kosovar independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2209907,00.html |title=Bosnian nightmare returns to haunt EU |author=Simon Tisdall |date=2007-11-13 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanian leaders was postponed until the end of the [[Serbian presidential election, 2008|Serbian presidential elections]] (4 February 2008). Most [[Member State of the European Union|EU members]] and the US had feared that a premature declaration could boost support in Serbia for the ultra-nationalist candidate, [[Tomislav Nikolić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6386467.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Q&amp;A: Kosovo's future |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, the [[OSCE]] supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13208.html: OSCE Mission in Kosovo - Elections] &quot;, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&lt;/ref&gt; After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as President and [[Bajram Rexhepi]] (PDK) as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1846264.stm: Power-sharing deal reached in Kosovo] &quot;, [[BBC News]], 21 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in [[Ramush Haradinaj]] (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publicinternationallaw.org/docs/BW2005/Balkan_Watch.11April_05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|Parliamentary elections]] were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, [[Hashim Thaçi]] who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]], and stated his intention to declare independence. Thaçi formed a coalition with current President [[Fatmir Sejdiu]]'s [[Democratic League of Kosovo|Democratic League]] which was in second place with 22 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7179850.stm: Kosovo gets pro-independence PM] &quot;, BBC News, 9 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The turnout at the election was particularly low. Most members of the Serb minority refused to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=454473&amp;lng=1 EuroNews: Ex-guerrilla chief claims victory in Kosovo election]. Retrieved 18 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since 1999, the Serb-inhabited areas of Kosovo, such as [[North Kosovo]] have remained ''de facto'' independent from the Albanian-dominated government in [[Pristina]]. [[Local government|Local politics]] in the Serb areas are dominated by the [[Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija]]. The Serbian List is led by ''Oliver Ivanović'', an engineer from Mitrovica. Within Serbia, Kosovo is the concern of the Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija, currently led by [[Slobodan Samardzic]].

The UN Security Council remains divided on the question ({{As of|2008|7|4|lc=on}}). Of the five members with [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto power]], USA, UK, and France [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognised]] the declaration of independence, and the [[People's Republic of China]] has expressed concern, while Russia considers it [[International recognition of Kosovo|illegal]]. {{As of|2008|10}}, no member-country of [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation|CSTO]] or [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization|SCO]] has recognised Kosovo as independent. Kosovo has not made a formal application for [[UN]] membership yet in view of a possible veto from Russia and China.

The [[European Union]] has no official position towards Kosovo's status, but has decided to deploy the [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo]] to ensure a continuation of international civil presence in Kosovo. {{As of|2008|4}}, most of the member-countries of [[NATO]], [[European Union|EU]], [[Western European Union|WEU]] and [[OECD]] have recognised Kosovo as independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosovothanksyou.com/stats.php |title=Recognition Information and Statistics - Who Recognized Kosova?

{{As of|2008|10|9}}, all of Kosovo's immediate neighbour states except [[Serbia]] have recognised the declaration of independence. [[Montenegro]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] announced their recognition of Kosovo on 9 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7662149.stm BBC News, ''http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7662149.stm''].

The Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposes the declaration of independence, has formed the [[Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija]] in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue because it will not have an operative role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/06/30/feature-01 |title=Kosovo Serbs convene parliament; Pristina, international authorities object (SETimes.com) |publisher=SETimes.com |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2008, the UN agreed to ask the [[International Court of Justice]] for a non-binding advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of Independence from Serbia, by a vote of 77-6-74 (77 in favour, 6 opposed and 74 abstentions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28492&amp;Cr=Kosovo&amp;Cr1= |title=UN World Court to give opinion on legality of Kosovo’s independence |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EULEX==
The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) is the largest civilian mission ever launched under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The central aim is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities in the rule of law area, specifically in the police, judiciary and customs areas. The mission is not in Kosovo to govern or rule. It is a technical mission which will monitor, mentor and advise whilst retaining a number of limited executive powers. EULEX works under the general framework of United Nations Security Resolution 1244 and has a unified [[chain of command]] to Brussels. It has around 3,000 staff, (1,900 international, 1,100 local) and a budget of 205 million Euros for the first 16 months. The head of the mission is [[Yves de Kermabon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?id=2 |title=What is EULEX - EULEX Kosovo |publisher=Eulex-kosovo.eu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local politics in the Serb areas are dominated by the [[Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija]]. The Serbian List is led by [[Oliver Ivanović]], an engineer from Kosovska Mitrovica.

In February 2007 the Union of Serbian Districts and District Units of Kosovo and Metohija transformed into the Serbian Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija, presided by [[Marko Jakšić]], a hardline nationalist residing in the northern part of the divided city of Mitrovica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/659/story/684058.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L28603646.htm |title=Reuters AlertNet - Kosovo Serbs convene parliament, rejecting new state |publisher=Alertnet.org |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has demanded unity of the Serb people in Kosovo, boycotted [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo|EULEX]], and announced massive protests in support of Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo. On 18 February 2008, day after Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, the Assembly declared it &quot;null and void&quot;.

==Constitutional Status and the Republic of Kosovo==
{{See|Constitution of Kosovo}}
The Republic of Kosovo is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]]. The [[Executive (government)|executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Kosovo]] led by the [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]]. Two or three of the ministers, depending on the size of the government, are required to be from the minorities. The [[President of the Republic of Kosovo]] is the head of state. The judiciary is independent. The [[Legislature|legislative power]] is exercised by the single-chamber [[Assembly of Kosovo]] consisting of 120 members, 100 of them directly elected by the people for a four-year term and twenty seats reserved for representatives of the [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] only. The assembly elects the president for five years and approves the government.

A new constitution for the Republic of Kosovo was approved by the Parliament of the Republic of Kosovo, coming to force on June 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/06/15/kosovo.constitution.ap/ CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,1 Constitution of Kosovo - Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i-eG5b77lXRmme6EL1zWnRK5mdEQ AFP]; [http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12779731&amp;PageNum=0 ITAR-TASS]&lt;/ref&gt;
Kosovo is under ''de facto'' governance of the Republic of Kosovo except for [[North Kosovo]], which remains under ''de facto'' governance of Serbia. The Republic of Kosovo is governed by legislative, executive and judicial institutions that derive from, and are set-up in, accordance with the [[Constitution of Kosovo]]. In November 2001, the OSCE supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13208.html: |title=OSCE Mission in Kosovo - Elections |publisher=Osce.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last parliamentary and local elections were held in [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|in 2007]]. [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] has undergone a significant reconfiguration, and no longer possesses the capacity, having handed over its few responsibilities to [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo|EULEX]], to govern in any meaningful fashion. It will, its head claims, function as a facilitator of contact between Kosovo and those states or organisations which do not recognise it yet. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bsanna-news.ukrinform.ua/newsitem.php?id=7069&amp;lang=en |title=Bsanna News - Bsanna News |publisher=Bsanna-news.ukrinform.ua |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government and politics====
{{Main|Politics of Kosovo}}
===Parties===
The largest [[political parties in Kosovo]] are the [[centre-right]] [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] (LDK), which has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Miloševic's rule and was led by [[Ibrahim Rugova]] until his death in 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;ku&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.europeanforum.net/country.php/kosovo_update#4: Kosovo Update: Main Political Parties] &quot;, European Forum, 18 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and two parties having their roots in the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA): the [[centre-left]] [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]] (PDK) led by former KLA leader [[Hashim Thaçi]] and the centre-right [[Alliance for the Future of Kosovo]] (AAK) led by former KLA commander [[Ramush Haradinaj]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ku&quot;/&gt; Kosovo publisher [[Veton Surroi]] in 2004 formed the centre-left [[Reformist Party ORA]]. Kosovo Serbs formed the [[Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija]] (SLKM) in 2004 and won several seats, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ku&quot;/&gt; In 2006 Swiss-Kosovar businessman [[Behgjet Pacolli]], reputed to be the richest living Albanian, founded the [[New Kosovo Alliance]] (AKR), which came third in the 2007 elections.

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Kosovo}}
Currently 14 countries maintain [[List of diplomatic missions in Kosovo|embassies to the Republic of Kosovo]]. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, {{Kosovorecognition}} countries recognise Kosovo as independent.

====Military====
{{Main|Military of Kosovo}}
A 2,500-strong Kosovo [[Police|Security Force]] (KSF) is to be trained by NATO and will be operational toward the end of 2009. The KSF will replace the Kosovar Protection Service (KPS) which had been made up mainly of former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the separatist guerrillas who fought Serbia during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) – Jan 21, 2009 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFUhM_dkT5VtQbsmvcICbBGZDF9Q |title=AFP: New Kosovo security force angers Serbia |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule of law===
Following the [[Kosovo War]], due to the many weapons in the hands of civilians, law enforcement inefficiencies, and widespread devastation, both [[gjakmarrja|revenge killings]] and [[ethnic violence]] surged tremendously. The number of reported murders rose 80% from 136 in 2000 to 245 in 2001. The number of reported arsons rose 140% from 218 to 523 over the same period. UNMIK pointed out that the rise in reported incidents might simply correspond to an increased confidence in the police force (i.e., more reports) rather than more actual crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;unmikstat&quot;&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/civpol/statistics.htm UNMIK statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[UNODC]], by 2008, murder rates in Kosovo had dropped by 75% in five years&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/10585/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] report, March 2008. P. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of noted serious crimes increased between 1999 and 2000, since then it has been &quot;starting to resemble the same patterns of other European cities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unmikstat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwpr.net/?p=bcr&amp;s=f&amp;o=249549&amp;apc_state=henibcr2001 Kosovo Crime Wave], 17 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], the aftermath of the war resulted in an increase in the [[trafficking of women]] for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3686173.stm Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade'], [[BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071213220014/http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng Kosovo: Trafficked women and girls have human rights], Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade'], [[Guardian.co.uk|Guardian Unlimited]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] data, in 2000-2004, Kosovo was consistently ranked fourth or fifth among the countries of Southeastern Europe by number of [[human trafficking]] victims, after Albania, [[Moldova]], [[Romania]] and sometimes [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iom.int&quot;&gt;[http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/published_docs/studies_and_reports/second_annual05.pdf Second Annual Report on Victims of Trafficking in South-Eastern Europe].

P. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residual landmines and other [[unexploded ordnance]] remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. Caution when travelling in remote areas is advisable. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/content/en/travel-advice/europe/12793683/FCO_TRV_ca_kosovo |title=Kosovo travel advice |publisher=Fco-stage.fco.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo is extremely vulnerable to [[organised crime]] and thus to [[money laundering]]. In 2000, international agencies estimated that Kosovo was supplying up to 40% of the heroin sold in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/mar/13/balkans |title=Kosovo drug mafia supply heroin to Europe &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[1997 rebellion in Albania|1997 unrest in Albania]] and the [[Kosovo War]] in 1998-1999 ethnic Albanian traffickers enjoyed a competitive advantage, which has been eroding as the region stabilises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[UNODC]] report, March 2008. P. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a 2008 report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], overall, ethnic Albanians, not only from Kosovo, supply 10 to 20% of the heroin in [[Western Europe]], and the traffic has been declining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[UNODC]] report, March 2008. P. 14, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] data, in 2000-2004, Kosovo was consistently ranked fourth or fifth among the countries of Southeastern Europe by number of human trafficking victims, after Albania, [[Moldova]], [[Romania]] and sometimes [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iom.int&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Kosovo}}
The climate is [[continental climate|continental]], with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. Most of Kosovo's terrain in mountainous, the highest peak is [[Đeravica]] ({{convert|2656|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}). There are two main plain regions, the [[Metohija]] basin is located in the western part of the Kosovo, and the [[Plain of Kosovo]] occupies the eastern part. The main rivers of the region are the [[White Drin]], running towards the [[Adriatic Sea]], with the [[Erenik]] among its [[Tributary|tributaries]]), the [[Sitnica]], the [[South Morava]] in the [[Goljak]] area, and [[Ibar River|Ibar]] in the north. The biggest lakes are [[Gazivoda Lake|Gazivoda]], [[Radonjić]], [[Lake Batlava|Batlava]] and [[Badovac Lake|Badovac]].
39.1% of Kosovo is [[forested]], about 52% is classified as agricultural land, 31% of which is covered by pastures and 69% is arable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rec.org/REC/Publications/CountryReports/Kosovo.PDF Strategic Environmental Analysis of Kosovo]. The Regional Environmental Centre for [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]], Prishtina, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Kosovo belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Kosovo belongs to the ecoregion of [[Balkan mixed forests]].Currently, the 39,000 ha Šar Mountains National Park, established in 1986 in the [[Šar Mountains]] along the border with the Republic of Macedonia, is the only [[national park]] in Kosovo, although the [[Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park]] in the [[Prokletije]] along the border with Montenegro has been proposed as another one.&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;&gt;[http://www.ks-gov.net/akmm/dokumente/Kosovo-Biodiversity%20Assessment.pdf Kosovo: Biodiversity assessment]. Final Report submitted to the [[USAID]], ARD-BIOFOR IQC Consortium, May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest cities are [[Pristina]], the capital, with an estimated 500,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osce.org/documents/mik/2008/04/1199_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The old city of [[Prizren]] is towards the south west, with a population of 110,000.

Kosovo is classified a [[developing country]] by US intelligence, with a per capita income estimated at [[Euro|€]]2,100 (2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/kv.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo had the largest exporting company (Trepca) in the Federal Republic of [[Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Crisis Group |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1585&amp;l=1 |title=International Crisis Group - Trepca: Making Sense of the La |publisher=Crisisgroup.org |date=1999-11-26 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia and received substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, [[international sanctions]], poor external commerce and [[ethnic conflict]] severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=World Bank Mission in Kosovo |author=The World Bank |date=2006/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in [[Gross domestic product|Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and was expected to be around 3 percent in 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining [[Aid|foreign assistance]]. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of [[goods and services]] was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.

Most [[economic development]] since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The [[Secondary sector of the economy|industrial sector]] remains weak and the [[electric power]] supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the [[Labor force|labour force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 |title=May finds Kosovo with 50% unemployed |author=eciks |date= 2006-05-04 |accessdate= 2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNMIK introduced an [[International trade|external trade]] regime and customs administration on September 3, 1999 when it set customs border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported in Kosovo face a flat 10% [[Customs|customs duty]] fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyUSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html |title=Doing Business in Kosovo |author=U.S. Commercial Service |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These taxes are collected from all Tax Collection Points installed at the borders of Kosovo, including those between Kosovo and Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080226204543/http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-26 |format=PDF |title=External Trade and Customs |author=Economic Reconstruction and Development in South East Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed [[Free trade|Free Trade]] Agreements with [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/globe-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=123&amp;nav_id=37090 |title=Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement |author=B92 |authorlink=B92 |date= 2006-10-02 |publisher=mrt.com |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNMIK and Bosnia and Herzegovina Initial Free Trade Agreement|author=EU in Kosovo|date=17/02/06|publisher=UNMIK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyUSA&quot;/&gt;

The [[Euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and is used by UNMIK and the government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080214232830/http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php |archivedate=2008-02-14 |title=Invest in Kosovo |author=EU in Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Kosovo adopted the [[Deutsche Mark|German mark]] in 1999 to replace the [[Yugoslav dinar]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/437844.stm BBC News, Kosovo adopts Deutschmark]&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently switched to the Euro when the German mark was replaced by it. However, the [[Serbian dinar]] is still used in Serbian-populated areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

The chief means of entry, apart form the main highway leading to the south to [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], is [[Priština International Airport|Pristina International Airport]].

===Trade and investment===
The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm |title=Brussels offers first Kosovo loan |author=BBC News |date= 2005-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving [[Underground economy|black economy]] in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of [[Political corruption|official corruption]] and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosovo.undp.org/?cid=2,1,54 |title=United Nations Development Programme |publisher=Kosovo.undp.org |date=2004-08-31 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo has a reported [[External debt|foreign debt]] of 1,264&amp;nbsp;billion USD that is currently serviced by Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2637230220080226 |title=Serbia should stop servicing Kosovo debt: EconMin &amp;#124; International |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ECIKS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eciks.org/english/invest.php?action=total_invest&amp;main_id=13 ECIKS]&lt;/ref&gt; from 2001 to 2004 Kosovo received $3,2&amp;nbsp;billion of foreign aid. International donor conference is to be held in Switzerland in June or July 2008. Until now EU pledged €2&amp;nbsp;billion, $350 mil by USA. Serbia also pledged €120&amp;nbsp;million to Serb's enclaves in Kosovo.

Kosovo joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] on 26 June 2009 as the 186th country to join the two institutions. 95% of Kosovars had previously voted in favour of the move.

The accession follows a 50% tax reduction implemented in 2008 which has helped double investment in the country, setting the economy for an expected growth of &quot;around 4.0 percent to 5.0 percent&quot; in 2010, according to IMF projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Veronica |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iwijpFreGbpOGE8KHVX9mMXi-iqA |title=AFP: Kosovo joins IMF, World Bank amid independence row |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative regions==
Kosovo, for administrative reasons, is considered as consisting of seven districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/bd/bdy/bdy_kos |title=Kosovo: Delimiting Electoral Districts for a Proportional Representation System — ACE Electoral Knowledge Network |publisher=Aceproject.org |date= |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[North Kosovo]] maintains its own government, infrastructure and institutions by its dominant ethnic [[Serb]] population in the [[District of Kosovska Mitrovica]], viz. in the [[Leposavić]], [[Zvečan]] and [[Zubin Potok]] municipalities and the northern part of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]].

According to the Kosovo in Figures 2005 Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080309073836/http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-09 |format=PDF |title=Kosovo in figures 2005 |author=UNMIK |publisher=Ministry of Public Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |author=BBC News |date=2005-12-23 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=churchesRegions and territories: Kosovo |author=BBC News |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2&amp;nbsp;million with the following ethnic composition: [[Albanians]] 92%, [[Serbs]] 4%, [[Bosniaks]] and [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorans]] 2%, [[Turkish people|Turks]] 1%, [[Romani people|Roma]] 1%. [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] estimates the following ratio: 88% [[Albanians]], 8% [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] and 4% other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to latest CIA The World Factbook estimated data, as of July 2009, Kosovo's population stands at '''1,804,838''' persons.It stated that ethnic composition is &quot;Albanians 88%, Serbs 7%, other 5% (Bosniak, Gorani, Roma, Turk, Ashkali, Egyptian)&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html#People |title=World Factbook |author=CIA |publisher=CIA |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanians, steadily increasing in number, have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, the earlier ethnic composition being disputed. Kosovo's political boundaries do not coincide with ethnic boundaries; Serbs form a local majority in [[North Kosovo]] and [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|several smaller enclaves]], while there are large areas with Albanian majority outside Kosovo in the neighbouring regions of former Yugoslavia, namely in the Northwest of the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and in [[Presevo]] of [[Central Serbia]].

At 1.3% per year, ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the fastest rate of growth in population in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml Albanian Population Growth]&lt;/ref&gt; Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew to 460% of its original size. If growth continues at such a pace, the population will reach 4.5&amp;nbsp;million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080212143112/http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtinë]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is unlikely to happen; until about 1990, Kosovo Albanians had very high birth rates of about 4 children per woman, similar to many poor developing countries (such as [[Haiti]] or [[Ghana]]), but this has fallen down to about two since then and will likely sink below replacement eventually, as it has in [[Albania]] itself. In addition, Kosovo has a high emigration rate now which it did not have before 1990.

By contrast, from [[Demographics of Kosovo#World War II-1968|1948]] to [[Demographics of Kosovo#1989-1999: Centralized Yugoslav Control|1991]], the Serb population of Kosovo increased by but twelve percent (one third the growth of the population in Central Serbia). The population of Albanians in Kosovo increased by three hundred percent in the same period{{ndash}} a rate of growth twenty-five times that of the Serbs in Kosovo. Serbs, similar to most other [[Eastern Europe]]an Christian ethnic groups, since about 1990 have had very low birth rates (about 1.5 children per woman) and more deaths than births. This ensures a continued dwindling of the Serb minority as a percentage of the population, even with the dropping births among the Albanians.

Since Kosovo's declaration of independence, Serbs have increasingly fled the region, causing anxiety for Kosovan leaders and encouraging the claims of Serbian politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/DPI/LocalMed.nsf/0/FDF5C7A3B9C50ECAC125756D00402E66/$FILE/lmm010309.pdf UNMIK Headlines, March 1, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
The native dialect of the Kosovar Albanian population is [[Gheg Albanian]], although Standard [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is now widely used as an official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aln Albanian, Gheg A language of Serbia and Montenegro]. Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. ''[[Ethnologue|Ethnologue: Languages of the World]]'', Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: [[SIL International]]. Online version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Moosmüller &amp; Theodor Granser.

''Language Variation and Change'' (2006), 18: 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the draft [[Constitution of Kosovo]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is another official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovoconstitution.info/repository/docs/DraftConstitutionEnglish.pdf Draft Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[Islam]] (mostly [[Sunni]], with a [[Bektashi]] minority&lt;ref name=&quot;babuna&quot;/&gt;) is the predominant [[religion]] in Kosovo, brought into the region with the [[History of Ottoman Kosovo|Ottoman conquest]] in the 15th century and now nominally professed by most of the ethnic Albanians, by the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities, and by some of the [[Romani people|Roma]]/[[Ashkali]]-&quot;[[Ashkali|Egyptian]]&quot; community. Islam, however, hasn't saturated the Kosovar society, which remains largely secular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23258488/ Kosovo touts 'Islam Lite']. The [[Associated Press]], February 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; About three percent of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo remain [[Roman Catholic]] despite centuries of the Ottoman rule. The Serb population, estimated at 100,000 to 120,000 persons, is largely [[Serbian Orthodox]]. Kosovo is densely covered by numerous [[List of Serbian Orthodox monasteries#Kosovo-Metohia|Serb Orthodox churches and monasteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1 |title=Religion in Kosovo |author=International Crisis Group |date=2001-01-31 |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90198.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2007 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71405.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2006 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia and Montenegro (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are well documented as having been destroyed, by criminals unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,FORUM18,,SRB,,468918a14,0.html |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Kosovo: Nobody charged for destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries |publisher=UNHCR |date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations between Albanian and Serb communities===
[[File:Kosovo day.jpg|thumb|left|Serbs hold a strong cultural attachment to Kosovo and see it as the cultural heartland of Serbia, here a [[World War I]] poster - “Kossovo Day” from 1916 inviting Allied solidarity with Serbia.]]

The relations between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian and Serb populations have been hostile since the rise of nationalistm in the Balkans during the 19th century, rivalry which became strong after Serbia gained Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire in 1913 and after Albania became independent in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, Collective Action, and International Citizenship. New York: The United Nations University, 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period however, Serbs and Albanians within Kosovo enjoyed good-neighborly relations, working together to appose foreign meddling in the territory on many occasions&lt;ref&gt;See: Isa Blumi, Rethinking the Late Ottoman Empire: A Comparative Social and [[Political history|Political History]] of Albania and Yemen, 1878-1918 (Istanbul: The Isis Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tito-era of communist rule in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanian and Serb populations of Kosovo were strongly irreconcilable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanian and Serb peoples in Kosovo rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabnel, Albrecht 2001. Pp. 24&quot;&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and Serbs have remained common for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabnel, Albrecht 2001. Pp. 24&quot;/&gt; The level of intolerance and separation between the ethnic Albanian and Serb communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer relations between each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schabnel, Albrecht 2001. Pp. 24&quot;/&gt;

===Cinema and media===
{{Main|Music of Kosovo}}
Although in Kosovo the music is diverse, authentic [[Music of Albania|Albanian music]] (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. Albanian music is characterised by the use of the ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''. [[Classical music]] is also well-known in Kosovo and has been taught at several [[List of pre-college music schools|music schools]] and [[universities]] (at the [[University of Priština#Albanian university|University of Prishtina Faculty of Arts]] in [[Pristina]] and the [[Faculty of Arts of Pristina|University of Priština Faculty of Arts]] at [[Kosovska Mitrovica]]).

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Kosovo}}

Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 &quot;Law on Sport&quot; passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo|Olympic Committee]], regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for [[sports club]]s. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.
