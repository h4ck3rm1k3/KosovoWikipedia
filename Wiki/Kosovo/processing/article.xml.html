In the 4th to 3rd centuries  BC, it was the territory of the <a href='Thraco-Illyrian'>Thraco-Illyrian</a> tribe of the <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a>, forming part of the  kingdom of <a href='Illyria'>Illyria</a>. The Illyrians were conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and made the Roman province of <a href='Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum'>Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum</a> in 59 BC. The Kosovo region became part of <a href='Moesia Superior'>Moesia Superior</a> in AD 87. The <a href='Slavic migrations'>Slavic migrations</a> reached the Balkans in the 6th to 7th century. The area was absorbed into the <a href='Byzantine empire'>Byzantine empire</a> in the 850s. As the center of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, it often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> conquered it by the end of the <a href='11th century'>11th century</a>.</p>
<p>Fully absorbed into the Serbian Kingdom until the end of the <a href='12th century|12th'>12th century|12th</a>, it became the secular and spiritual center of the <a href='History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state'>History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state</a> of the <a href='House of NemanjiÄ|Nemanyiden'>House of NemanjiÄ|Nemanyiden</a> dynasty in the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, with the Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church in <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a>, while <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> was the secular center. The zenith was reached with the formation of a <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a> in 1346, which after 1371 transformed from a centralized absolutist medieval monarchy to a feudal realm. Kosovo became the hereditary land of the <a href='House of BrankoviÄ'>House of BrankoviÄ</a> and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a> and <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a> flourished.</p>

In 1402 a <a href='Serbian Despotate'>Serbian Despotate</a> was raised and Kosovo became its richest territory, famous for mines. 
The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>.

In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of Christians in Kosovo deteriorated, including full imposition of <a href='jizya'>jizya</a> (taxation of non-Muslims).</p>

<p>The <a href='Young Turk'>Young Turk</a> movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians. In 1910, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from PriÅ¡tina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911.

In the <a href='1974'>1974</a> constitution, the <a href='Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo'>Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo</a>'s government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia.

The ethnic balance of Kosovo tilted as the number of Albanians tripled, rising from almost 75% to over 90%, but the number of Serbs barely increased, dropping from 15% to 8% of the total population. Even though Kosovo was the least developed area of the former Yugoslavia, the living and economic prospects and freedoms were far greater than under the totalitarian <a href='Enver Hoxha|Hoxha'>Enver Hoxha|Hoxha</a> regime in Albania. Beginning in March <a href='1981'>1981</a>, Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Serbs and Yugoslav state authorities resulting in increased emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="reuters19860527"&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csm19860728"&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.&lt;ref name="nyt19870627"&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, the <em>Republic of Kosova</em>.

However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs.</p>

According to Amnesty International, the aftermarth of the war resulted in an increase in the <a href='trafficking of women'>trafficking of women</a> for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3686173.stm Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade''>11</a>, <a href='BBC'>BBC</a>.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng Kosovo: Trafficked women and girls have human rights'>12</a>, <a href='Amnesty International'>Amnesty International</a>.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade''>13</a>, <a href='Guardian Unlimited'>Guardian Unlimited</a>.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Kosovo that established the <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister.  Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year).</p>
<p>In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War.  The <a href='2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004'>2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004</a> was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S State Department Report, published in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

The <a href='UN'>UN</a>-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock'>14</a> ", <em>BBC News</em>, October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p> 
In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the <a href='United States'>United States</a>, the <a href='United Kingdom'>United Kingdom</a> and other European members of the <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a>, was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29/06/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date=09/07/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=30/03/07 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

A declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanian leaders was postponed until the end of the Serbian presidential elections (4 February 2008).
