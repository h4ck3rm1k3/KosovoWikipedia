{{Infobox Kosovdetermination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.

In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.

According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.  

The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named &quot;Ora.&quot;  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.  

In November 2001, the [[OSCE]] supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.  

After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in [[Ramush Haradinaj]] (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.  

Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander [[Agim Ceku]].  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected [[Fatmir Sejdiu]], a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. Slaviša Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds] &quot;, Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM] &quot;, Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.

===Kosovo status process===

{{main|Kosovo status process}}
{{seealso|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] which ended the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] of 1999. Whilst Serbia's continued sovereignty over Kosovo is recognised by the international community, a clear majority of the province's population would prefer independence. 

The [[UN]]-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] &quot;, ''BBC News'', October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 a draft resolution, backed by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on [[20 July]] [[2007]], having failed to secure Russian backing. Kosovo Albanian leaders have reacted by proposing unilateral independence for [[28 November]] [[2007]], though the UN would be required to overrule any such action.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/fc/World/Kosovo | Kosovo pushes independence after UN action fails | accessdate=2007-07-20&lt;/ref&gt; Violence is feared in Kosovo should Kosovo Albanian demands for independence not be met.


== Health ==

Access to health care is free for all residents of Kosovo. Currently there is no health insurance, however, the Ministry of Health is in the process is preparing a legislative infrastructure, which is scheduled to be implemented next year.

There are hospitals in all major cities. A total of 6 regional hospitals provide tertiary health care, and family centers in small municipalities.

Medical Education is available at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo (UCCK), in Priština.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Kosovo}}

[[Image:Kosovo stamp.jpg‎|thumb|left|100px|[[Postage stamp]] from Kosovo issued after the 1999 Kosovo War.]]

Kosovo has one of the most under-developed economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at [[Euro|€]]1,565 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html worldbank.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, international sanctions, poor external commerce and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html worldbank.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNMIK introduced ''de-facto'' an external trade regime and customs administration on [[September 3]], [[1999]] when it set customs border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported in Kosovo face a flat 10% customs duty fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt; These taxes are collected from all Tax Collection Points installed at the borders of Kosovo, including those between Kosovo and  Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed Free Trade Agreements with [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/globe-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=123&amp;nav_id=37090 Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement], [[B92]], 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf euinkosovo.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovo-eicc.org/oek/index.php?page_id=64&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] is Kosovo's largest import and export market (averaging €220 million and €9 million, respectively), followed by Serbia-Montenegro (€111 million and €5 million), Germany and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVO/147270-1121700806276/20953280/Kosovo_Economic_Briefing_april.pdf Kosovo Economic Briefing (April)], worldbank.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and used by UNMIK and the government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian [[Dinar]] is used in the Serbian populated parts.

The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm Brussels offers first Kosovo loan]&quot;, BBC News Online, 3 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovo.undp.org/Projects/TIK/tik.asp ''Transparency Initiative for Kosovo (TIK)''], UN Development Programme in Kosovo.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
: ''See also: [[List of Albanians#Musicians|Albanian and Kosovo, Albanian musicians]], [[Music of Kosovo]], [[Music of Serbia]], [[List of Serbian musicians]]
[[Music]] has always been a part of the [[Culture of Albania|Albanian]] and [[Serbian culture]]. Although in Kosovo music is diverse (as it got mixed with the cultures of different regimes dominating in Kosovo), authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. The Albanian one is characterized by use of ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''.
In Kosovo, along with modern music, [[folk]] music is very popular. There are many folk [[singers]] and ensembles (both Albanian and Serbian). [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at [[universities]] (at the [[University of Pristina#Albanian university|University of Prishtina Faculty of Arts]]  and the [[University of Pristina#Serbian university|University of Priština at Kosovska Mitrovica]]  [[Faculty of Arts of Priština|Faculty of Arts]]) and several pre-[[college]] [[List of pre-college music schools|music school]]s
The modern music in Kosovo has its origin from the Western countries. The main modern genres include: [[Pop (music)|Pop]], [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]], [[Rock (music)|Rock]] and [[Jazz]]. The most notable rock bands are: Gjurmët, Troja, Votra, Diadema, Humus, Asgjë sikur Dielli, Kthjellu, [[Cute Babulja]], [[Babilon]], etc. Ilir Bajri is a notable [[jazz]] and [[Electronic Music|electronic]] musician. Most notable hip-hop performers are the rap-group called NR (urbaNRoots) who also introduced a new type of rap different to the G-Funk that was widely spread before. Other hip-hop artists include [[Unikkatil]] (who lives in the USA but represents Kosovo), Tingulli 3, Ritmi I Rrugës, Mad Lion, K-OS and many more.

[[Leonora Jakupi]] and [[Adelina Ismajli]] are two of the most popular commercial singers in Kosovo today.
