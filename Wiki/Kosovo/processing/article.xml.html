In ancient times the area has been known as <a href='Dardania (Europe)|Dardania'>Dardania (Europe)|Dardania</a> and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a> were of Illyrian or Thracian stock. Illyrians organised resistance against <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for hundreds of years but after the long wars of Illyrian tribes against intruders, the region was later occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a>. When the Roman Empire split in <a href='Anno Domini|A.D.'>Anno Domini|A.D.</a>&amp;nbsp;<a href='395'>395</a>, the Kosovo region came under the <a href='Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire'>Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire</a>, later known as the Byzantine Empire.</p>

They were invited to settle in the area south of <a href='Danube'>Danube</a> as farmers by Byzantine emperor <a href='Heraclius'>Heraclius</a> to protect the area from invading <a href='Eurasian Avars|Avars'>Eurasian Avars|Avars</a>. The slavs were <a href='Christianization|Christianized'>Christianization|Christianized</a> in several waves between the <a href='7th century|7th'>7th century|7th</a> and <a href='9th century'>9th century</a> with the last wave taking place between <a href='867'>867</a> and <a href='874'>874</a>. But by then Kosovo proper was ruled by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians'>First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians</a> and <a href='Byzantines'>Byzantines</a> from the 850s until <a href='1014'>1014</a>, while Metohija became a part of the Grand Principality of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a>.</p>

In <a href='1093'>1093</a>, Prince Vukan advanced all the way to <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The <a href='Byzantine Emperor'>Byzantine Emperor</a> himself came to <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a> for negotiations. A peace was concluded, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. His armies stormed Kosovo. Byzantine Emperor Alexius had to come to Lipljan in <a href='1094'>1094</a> and negotiate again. Peace was concluded and Vukan gave hostages to the Emperor, including his nephews UroÅ¡ and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the warring in <a href='1106'>1106</a>, once again defeating John Comnenus' army, but Vukan's following death put a halt to a total conquest of Kosovo.</p>

In <a href='1166'>1166</a> - <a href='1168'>1168</a>, a <a href='Serbs|Serbian'>Serbs|Serbian</a> nobleman from <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a>, <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>Stefan Nemanja</a>, the founder of the <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja</a> asserted to the <a href='Rascia'>Rascian</a> Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo in an uprising against the <a href='Byzantine Emperor'>Byzantine Emperor</a>. He defeated the previous <a href='Grand Prince'>Grand Prince</a>, his brother, Tihomir's army at <a href='Pantino'>Pantino</a>. Nemanja was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests, and vouched to the <a href='Byzantine Emperor'>Byzantine Emperor</a> that he would not raise his hand against him. In <a href='1183'>1183</a>, Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the Hungarians after the</p>
<p> 
Byzantine Emperor's death. Nemanja's son, <a href='Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stephen II the First-crowned of Nemanja'>Stefan PrvovenÄani|Stephen II the First-crowned of Nemanja</a>, recorded Nemanja's conquests, as Nemanja restored Kosovo from the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a>, the border of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian realm'>History of Serbia|Serbian realm</a> reaching the river of <a href='Lab'>Lab</a>. Grand Prince Stephen II finished the inclusion of the Kosovo territories in <a href='1208'>1208</a>, by which time he had conquered <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> and <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a>, and moved the border of his realm to the <a href='Å ar mountain'>Å ar mountain</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href='1217'>1217</a>, the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom'>History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom</a> achieved recognition. In <a href='1219'>1219</a>, an autocephalous <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> was created, with the <a href='Hvosno'>Hvosno</a>, <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> and <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a> <a href='Bishoprics|Episcoprics'>Bishoprics|Episcoprics</a> on Kosovo. By the end of the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, the centre of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church</a> was moved to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> from <a href='Å½iÄa'>Å½iÄa</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href='13th century'>13th century</a>, Kosovo becomes the heart of the Serbian political and religious life with the Å ar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was that in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a>. On an island was <a href='SvrÄin'>SvrÄin</a> and on the coast <a href='Å timlji'>Å timlji</a>, and in the mountains was the Castle of <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating and as the rulers' living quarters. After <a href='1291'>1291</a>, the <a href='Tartars'>Tartars</a> broke all the way to <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a>. <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a> managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the <a href='Mother of Christ'>Mother of Christ</a> of LjeviÅ¡ka in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> around <a href='1307'>1307</a>, which became the seat of the Prizren Episcopric and the magnificent <a href='GraÄanica'>GraÄanica</a> in <a href='1335'>1335</a>, the seat of the <a href='Lipljan'>Lipljan</a> Episcopric. In 1331, Juvenille King DuÅ¡an attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in <a href='Nerodimlje'>Nerodimlje</a>. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of <a href='PetriÄ'>PetriÄ</a>, but DuÅ¡an captures him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palailogos and their children in <a href='ZveÄan'>ZveÄan</a>, where the dethroned King died on <a href='11 November'>11 November</a> <a href='1331'>1331</a>.</p>

In <a href='1241'>1241</a>-<a href='1242'>1242</a> <a href='Mongols'>Mongols</a> swept Eastern Europe and Balkans chaising, unsuccessfully, Arpad King <a href='Bela IV'>Bela IV</a>. <a href='Stefan Milutin|Milutin'>Stefan Milutin|Milutin</a> became a <a href='vassal'>vassal</a> of <a href='Mongol'>Mongol</a> ruler <a href='Emir Nogay'>Emir Nogay</a>, while his older brother <a href='Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin'>Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin</a> was the vassal of <a href='Bela IV'>Bela IV</a>,
continuing the vassalship of their father <a href='Uros'>Uros</a>. Shismatic Rascian Orthodox Church <a href='Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin'>Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin</a> was requested to convert to Roman Catholicism, which he did, before he could marry <a href='Bela'>Bela</a>'s grand-daughter Katalin and rule her patrimony of Srem, <a href='Macva'>Macva</a>, Usora, Soli, Bosnia, Podrinje and the lands toward east up to the Ibar River.</p>
<p>In <a href='1327'>1327</a> and <a href='1328'>1328</a>, <a href='List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King'>List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King</a> <a href='Stefan DeÄanski|Stefan of Dechani'>Stefan DeÄanski|Stefan of Dechani</a> started forming the vast <a href='DeÄani'>DeÄani</a> domain, although, Serbian King <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an|DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an|DuÅ¡an</a> would finish it in <a href='1335'>1335</a>.</p>
<a name="Serbian_Empire"></a><h4>Serbian Empire</h4><p><a href='Monarch|King'>Monarch|King</a> and <a href='Tsar'>Tsar</a> <a href='Stefan DuÅ¡an'>Stefan DuÅ¡an</a> founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archaengel near <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> in <a href='1342'>1342</a>-<a href='1352'>1352</a>. King DuÅ¡an declared himself as <em>Emperor of Serbs and Greeks</em> in <a href='1345'>1345</a>, thereby starting the <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a>. Stefan DuÅ¡an received John Cantakuzines in <a href='1342'>1342</a> in his Castle in <a href='Pauni'>Pauni</a> to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In <a href='1346'>1346</a>, the Serbian <a href='Archbishopric|Archepiscopric'>Archbishopric|Archepiscopric</a> at PeÄ was upgraded into a Patriarchate, but not recognized before <a href='1370'>1370</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a> fell into disarray prior to his death in <a href='1355'>1355</a>, feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar <a href='Stefan UroÅ¡ V'>Stefan UroÅ¡ V</a>. Kosovo became a domain of the <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ|House of MrnjavÄeviÄ</a>, but Prince Voislav VoinoviÄ expanded his demesne further onto Kosovo. The armies of King <a href='VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ'>VukaÅ¡in MrnjavÄeviÄ</a> from <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a> and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in <a href='1369'>1369</a>, putting a halt to his advances. After the Battle of Marica on <a href='26 September'>26 September</a> <a href='1371'>1371</a> in which the MrnjavÄeviÄ brothers lost their lives, <a href='House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ'>House of BalÅ¡iÄ|ÄuraÄ I BalÅ¡iÄ</a> of <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>Zeta (state)|Zeta</a> took <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> and <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a> in <a href='1372'>1372</a>. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the <a href='Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ'>Prince Lazar|House of LazareviÄ</a>.</p>
<p>The Ottomans invaded the Serbian Realm and met the coalition of South East European nobility on <a href='28 June'>28 June</a> <a href='1389'>1389</a>, near <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a>, at Gazi Mestan. The <a href='Serbian'>Serbian</a> Army was assisted by various allies. The epic <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a> followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> had 140,000. Through the cunning of <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> <a href='Sultan'>Sultan</a> <a href='Murad'>Murad</a> was murdered and the new Sultan <a href='Beyazid'>Beyazid</a> had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both <a href='Prince Lazar'>Prince Lazar</a> and <a href='MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ'>MiloÅ¡ ObiliÄ</a> were canonised by the <a href='Serbian Ortodox Church'>Serbian Ortodox Church</a> for their efforts in the battle. The local House of <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|BrankoviÄ</a> came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ</a>, with the temporary fall of the <a href='History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate'>History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate</a> in <a href='1439'>1439</a>. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by (self-proclaimed King) Gjergj Kastrioti <a href='Skanderbeg'>Skanderbeg</a>, and <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> troops supported by the BrankoviÄs in <a href='1448'>1448</a>. Skanderbeg's troops which were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the Brankovic's troops, who was more or less a Turkish <a href='Vassal'>Vassal</a>. Hungarian King <a href='John Hunyadi'>John Hunyadi</a> lost the battle after a 2-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the <a href='Ottoman Empire'>Ottoman Empire</a>, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in <a href='1459'>1459</a>.</p>
<p> 
In <a href='1455'>1455</a>, new castles arise in <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a> and <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, centres of the Ottoman vassalaged <a href='Vuk BrankoviÄ|House of BrankoviÄ'>Vuk BrankoviÄ|House of BrankoviÄ</a>.</p>
<a name="Ottomans"></a><h3>Ottomans</h3><p>The <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a> brought <a href='Islamisation'>Islamisation</a> with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the <a href='Viyalet of Kosovo'>Viyalet of Kosovo</a> as one of the <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> territorial entities. This brought a great shift, as the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Serb'>Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Serb</a> population began to lose its majority when masses of <a href='Turkish people|Turks'>Turkish people|Turks</a> and <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> (<a href='Muslims'>Muslims</a>) moved to Kosovo. During the Islamisation many Churches and Holy <a href='Orthodox Christian'>Orthodox Christian</a> places were raised to the ground or turned in to <a href='Mosques'>Mosques</a>. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> was teared down at the end of the 16th <a href='century'>century</a> and the material used to build the <a href='Mosque'>Mosque</a> of <a href='Sinan-pasha'>Sinan-pasha</a>, an Islamized <a href='Serb'>Serb</a>, in Prizren. Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of <a href='1683'>1683</a> - <a href='1699'>1699</a> with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a <a href='Catholic Archibishop'>Catholic Archibishop</a> <a href='PjetÃ«r Bogdani'>PjetÃ«r Bogdani</a>. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion. In <a href='1690'>1690</a>, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a>, who previously escaped a certain death, led 30,000 families from Kosovo, to evade <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a>. The people that followed him were probably mostly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a>, but some Orthodox Albanians too. Due to the terror from the <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottomans'>Ottoman Empire|Ottomans</a>, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo and Metohija area continued throughout the <a href='18th century'>18th century</a>. It is also noted that some <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> adopted <a href='Islam'>Islam</a> and some even gradually fused with the predominantly Albanian Moslems and adopted their culture and even language. By the <a href='19th century'>19th century</a>, <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> replaced the <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> as the dominating nation of Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
Refugees from territories conquered in the <a href='1876'>1876</a>-<a href='1877'>1877</a> Serbo-Turkish war and <a href='1877'>1877</a>-<a href='1878'>1878</a> Russo-Turkish war inhabited almost every Kosovo and Macedonian town escaping from the Serbian army and population were committing against unarmed civilians. These populations are now known as 'muhaxher' (which means 'refugee') and are the ancestors of many who are still known by their same surnames, <em>Muhaxheri</em>. It is also estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 <em>Serbs</em> were cleansed out of the <a href='Vilayet of Kosovo'>Vilayet of Kosovo</a> between <a href='1876'>1876</a> and <a href='1912'>1912</a>, especially during the <a href='Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War'>Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War</a> in <a href='1897'>1897</a>. (see <a href='Demographic history of Kosovo'>Demographic history of Kosovo</a>)</p>
<p>Albanians formed the <a href='League of Prizren'>League of Prizren</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> in the <a href='19th century'>19th century</a>. Hundreds of Albanian leaders from all over Albania gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning them. They successfully opposed any Serbian invasion attempts. Serbia complained to the Western Powers that the promised territories were not being held because Ottomans were hesitating to do that. Western Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting against Albanians. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. In <a href='1910'>1910</a>, an <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> uprising spread from <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a> and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in <a href='June'>June</a> <a href='1911'>1911</a>. The Aim of the League of Prizren as to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However at that time Serbs have consisted about <em>40%</em> of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with other Slavs and Turks in Kosovo.</p>

And exodus of the local Moslem, especially Albanian population occured. This is best described by <a href='Leon Trotsky'>Leon Trotsky</a>, who was the reporter for the 'Pravda' newspaper at the time.

<a name="Yugoslavia_and_fascist_Albania"></a><h4>Yugoslavia and fascist Albania</h4><p>After the <a href='1918'>1918</a>-<a href='1929'>1929</a> period of the <a href='Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> and the <a href='1929'>1929</a>-<a href='1941'>1941</a> <a href='Kingdom of Yugoslavia'>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, Yugoslavia was invaded by the <a href='Axis forces'>Axis forces</a>. The greatest part of Kosovo became a part of <a href='Italy|Italian'>Italy|Italian</a>-controlled <a href='Greater Albania|Fascist Albania'>Greater Albania|Fascist Albania</a>, and smaller bits by the <a href='Nazism|Nazi'>Nazism|Nazi</a>-<a href='Fascist'>Fascist</a> <a href='Greater Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria'>Greater Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria</a> and <a href='Nazism|Nazi'>Nazism|Nazi</a> <a href='Germany|German'>Germany|German</a>-occupied <a href='Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia'>Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia</a>. Since the Albanians had decided in the <a href='Conference of Bujan'>Conference of Bujan</a> that Kosovo would remain Albanian, they have started immediately an ethnic cleansing of the non-Albanians in the occupied Kosovo. The infamous <a href='21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|SS Division Skanderbeg'>21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|SS Division Skanderbeg</a> is known to committed horrible crimes. Tens of thousands of Serbs lost their lives and around 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the war. Hundreds of thousands more would leave in the following decades, following the shift of power in Kosovo. Around 10,000 Serbs died in Albanian extirmination camps by the hand of militarist squadrons like the <a href='Vipurii'>Vipurii</a>.</p>
<p> 
After the war Kosovo gained the status of a province within <a href='Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia'>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia</a>. In the <a href='1974'>1974</a> constitution, Kosovo gained more powers and was advanced to a status of which was almost that of a republic, but not in name. It was part of a Yugoslav Federation to some extent and part of Serbia to some extent. It is disputed but there was some intention that Kosovo should become the seventh republic. For a better picture of the position of Kosovo within YU-Federation, it is best to give the example that no decision could be taken at the Federative level without the vote and consent of Kosovo.</p>
<p> 
In <a href='1981'>1981</a> the Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests were harshly attacked by the Serbian government. In 1986, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts published a document <a href='Memorandum'>Memorandum</a> which contained heavily Serbian nationalist rhetoric. With Serbian nationalism on the increase, <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ</a> came to power.</p>
<a name="Kosovar_unrests"></a><h5>Kosovar unrests</h5><p><em>see also: <a href='Kosovar War'>Kosovar War</a></em>
In <a href='1989'>1989</a>, following MiloÅ¡eviÄ's rise of power (especially the Gazimestan gathering, marking 600 years from the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>) the autonomy of Kosovo was revoked. Most Albanians organized a peaceful resistance movement. Most Albanians were expelled from their jobs, Albanian schools and the medical care system were shut down, and Kosovo was put under an effective <a href='apartheid'>apartheid</a>.</p>
<p> 
On July 2, <a href='1990'>1990</a> Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country. In September of that year, the parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of <a href='KaÃ§anik'>KaÃ§anik</a>, adopted the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. Two years later, Kosovo organized a referendum which was observed by international organisations but was not recognized internationally. With an 80% turnout, 98% voted for Kosovo to be independent. In January, <a href='1992'>1992</a> Albanians in <a href='Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia'>Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia</a> also voted for autonomy and independence in parts of western Macedonia. In the early nineties, Albanians organized a parallel state system which managed the non-violent resistance movement and organized a parallel system of education and healthcare, among other things.With the events in <a href='Bosnia'>Bosnia</a> and <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> coming to an end, the Serb government started moving some of the Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo. &lt;!-- started moving all of the refugees?? leave the word "some of the refugees" --&gt;In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make space for the refugees.</p>
<p>After the <a href='Dayton'>Dayton</a> Agreement in <a href='1995'>1995</a>, Albanians organized into the <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>Kosovo Liberation Army</a>. Yugoslav forces allegedly committed war crimes in Kosovo, although the Serbian government claims that the army was only going after suspected Albanian "terrorists". This triggered a 78-day <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> campaign in <a href='1999'>1999</a>. During the conflict, some 12,000 Kosovars were killed, of whome 9,000-10,000 were <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> and 1,000-2,000 others (<a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and <a href='Roma'>Roma</a>) and up to 700,000 Albanians and over 100,000 Serbs expelled. Some 3,000 Albanians are still missing. The number of Serbian soldier, policemen, and civilian deaths is considered to be around 3,000, but it's also disputed to be much more, as 2,800 people of Serb origin are still missing, believed dead. According to OSCE numbers and Kosovar Albanian sources on population size and distribution, an estimated 45.7 percent of the Albanian population and 59.5 percent of the Serb population had fled Kosovo during the bombings (i.e. from 23 March to 9 June 1999).</p>
<p> 
With the arrival of NATO, a large number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 100,000 by the UNHCR. Around 120,000 remain in Kosovo and oppose any rule by Albanians. Up to 300,000 non-Albanians (mostly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a>) fled Kosovo. This instills fear within the Albanians and makes them oppose return projects. Some 20,000 came back, mainly rural Serbs, while urban Serbs have largely integrated into Serbia and will not go back to Kosovo regardless of what their status will be. Many Serbs fear to return to their homes since it's proven not to be safe for them, even with <a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a> protection, notably the <a href='Unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004'>Unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004</a>, when 900 Serbian houses were burned and other property destroyed while the Serbian populace was 
closed into enclaves and had to concentrate to the north of Kosovo until today, causing a wave of 3,500 Serbian refugees. Among the numerious <a href='UNESCO'>UNESCO</a> World Heritage sites destroyed by the Albanian para-military forces is King <a href='Stefan Milutin'>Stefan Milutin</a>'s grave, <a href='Our Lady of LjeviÅ¡'>Our Lady of LjeviÅ¡</a> <a href='Orthodox'>Orthodox</a> <a href='Cathedral'>Cathedral</a> from the <a href='12th century'>12th century</a> in <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a>.</p>
<p> 
The Status talks started in February 2006, it is set to end in the course of the year. The security of the minorities, must be provided by Kosovo Albanian governments, but it is disputed if the Kosovo Albanian Institutions can grant these guarantees. The <a href='EU'>EU</a> still is said that they will not raise any demands for an independent Kosovo.</p>
<a name="Economy"></a><h2>Economy</h2><p><a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a> declared the <a href='euro'>euro</a> to be the official currency of the province in <a href='2001'>2001</a> in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the <a href='Deutschmark'>Deutschmark</a>, which had become the <em>de facto</em> currency even before the 1999 war. However, the <a href='Serbian dinar'>Serbian dinar</a> remains an official currency, used principally in the <a href='Kosovo Serb enclaves'>Kosovo Serb enclaves</a>; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro; Kosovo's administration uses the euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the <a href='United States dollar'>United States dollar</a> and <a href='Swiss franc'>Swiss franc</a> are the most widespread.</p>
<a name="Demographics"></a><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Ethnic Albanians comprise almost 90% of the population of the province. In the aftermath of the conflict some one thousand non-Albanians, particularly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and <a href='Roma'>Roma</a> either followed Serb soldiers as they withdrew, were forcibly expelled by the Albanian majority or fled the province to escape perceived threats of revenge by Albanians. The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall since the arrival of NATO and the UN as a result of violence, perceived intimidation, and economic hardship. Many still live in communal camps in <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> or <a href='Macedonia'>Macedonia</a> cared for by international relief agencies. However, there have been many attempts by Kosovo's government to resettle non-Albanians in the region which have largely been successful, including the resettlement of well over one thousand Serbians and Roma from 2004 - 2005. The Kosovo government has been widely praised for paying for the rebuilding of Serb houses in the aftermath of the 2004 riots. This has been marked as the first case of reparations in the history of the Balkans.</p>
<p> 
According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo<a href='http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf'>3</a>, Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1,8 and 2,0 million in the following ethnic proportions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>88%</em> <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> (between 1,584,000 and 1,733,600)</li>
<li> 
<em>7%</em> <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> (between 126,000 and 140,000)</li>
<li>	
<em>3%</em> <a href='Muslims by nationality|Muslims'>Muslims by nationality|Muslims</a> and <a href='Bosniaks'>Bosniaks</a> (54 to 60 thousand)</li>
<li> 
<em>2%</em> <a href='Roma people|Roma'>Roma people|Roma</a> (36 to 40 thousand) (see also <a href='Roma in Mitrovica Camps'>Roma in Mitrovica Camps</a>)</li>
<li><em>1%</em> <a href='Turkish people|Turks'>Turkish people|Turks</a> (18 to 20 thousand)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the figures are highly disputable. Some estimates are that there is an Albanian majority well above 90 percent.</p>
