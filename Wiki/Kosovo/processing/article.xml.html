The province is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the <a href='Yugoslavia|Yugoslav'>Yugoslavia|Yugoslav</a>) government and Kosovo's Albanian population. International negotiations began in <a href='2006'>2006</a> to determine the final status of Kosovo; it is widely expected that the talks will lead to some form of independence.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4489028 Kosovo's status - the wheels grind on'>1</a>", <em>The Economist</em>, October 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

The south of Kosovo was ruled by <a href='Macedon'>Macedon</a> since <a href='Alexander the Great'>Alexander the Great</a>'s reign in the 4th century BC. The local <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a> were of <a href='Illyrian'>Illyrian</a> or <a href='Thracian'>Thracian</a> stock. Illyrians resisted rule by the <a href='Greeks'>Greeks</a> and <a href='Ancient Rome|Romans'>Ancient Rome|Romans</a> for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading imperial powers, the region was eventually occupied by the <a href='Roman Empire'>Roman Empire</a> under Emperor <a href='Augustus'>Augustus</a> in 28 BC, although it is not clear whether it was part of the province of <a href='Moesia'>Moesia</a> or was divided between <a href='Dalmatia'>Dalmatia</a> and Moesia (a view which is supported by some archaeological evidence).&lt;ref name=Jankovic/&gt; Emperor <a href='Diocletian'>Diocletian</a> later (c. <a href='284'>284</a>) made Dardania into a separate province with its capital at Naissus (<a href='NiÅ¡'>NiÅ¡</a>).

<p>In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire</a>. Although <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> restored control over <a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a> throughout the 10th century, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire in a period of Bulgarian decline. However, Tsar <a href='Samuil of Bulgaria'>Samuil of Bulgaria</a> reconquered the whole of Kosovo in the late 10th century until the Byzantines restored their control over the area as they subjugated the Bulgarian Empire. In 1040-1041, Slavs staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantine control over the region continued.</p>
<p> 
Throughout the following decades, numerous foreign peoples invading the Byzantine Empire stormed Kosovo, among them the <a href='Cumans'>Cumans</a>.</p>
