<p>&lt;b&gt;Kosovo&lt;/b&gt; is a region in the Balkans with a ethnic <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> majority population. Its international status is anomalous in that although it is formally a province of the Republic of <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> under the sovereignty of <a href='Yugoslavia'>Yugoslavia</a>, actual administration is presently conducted by the <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> with no involvement on the part of the Serbian or Yugoslav governments.</p>
<p><br/>
Kosovo's anomalous status is the result of the <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a> of March-June <a href='1999'>1999</a>, in the course of which air strikes against Serbia and its armed forces by members of the <a href='North Atlantic Treaty Organization'>North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> secured the withdrawal of Serbia's military and the province's occupation by a NATO-led international force (KFOR) including <a href='Russia'>Russian</a> troops.</p>
<p> 
<br/></p>
<p>Entered by Serbs migrating from the north-east around the early 7th century AD, Kosovo was a centre of the medieval Serbian kingdom until its conquest by the <a href='Ottoman Empire|Ottoman'>Ottoman Empire|Ottoman</a> Turks in the late 14th century. The existing Albanian population was greatly added to by migrants from the west (modern <a href='Albania'>Albania</a>) during the centuries of Ottoman rule, when Islam also became the faith of most of the Albanian people.</p>
<p> 
<br/></p>
<p>Kosovo became a part of the revived kingdom of Serbia during the First <a href='Balkan Wars|Balkan War'>Balkan Wars|Balkan War</a> of 1912-1913, at which time Albanians numbered some 60-65% and Serbs 25-30% of the area's 400-500,000 inhabitants. Created an autonomous region of Serbia in 1946 and an autonomous province in 1963, Kosovo enjoyed almost complete self-government under predominantly Albanian local communist party leaders from 1974 until 1989, when its autonomy was revoked by a more nationalistic Serbian government following allegations of discrimination against the Serb minority.</p>
<p> 
<br/></p>
<p>Albanian opposition to Serbian sovereignty, which had surfaced in March 1981 rioting in the capital <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a>, subsequently took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the "Kosovo Liberation Army" (&lt;i&gt;Ushtria Clirimtare e Kosoves&lt;/i&gt;, or UCK). Guerrilla attacks and Serbian military action reduced the province by 1998 to a state of internal war, occasioning western intervention amid allegations of Serbian reprisals against Albanian civilians.</p>
<p> 
<br/></p>
<p>Both NATO and the UN continue to recognise Kosovo as a part of Serbia, but with the departure since 1999 of much of the Serb population and the reluctance of local Albanians to see Serbian sovereignty restored in practice, it is difficult to imagine how the removal of de facto Serbian authority in the province can be reconciled with assurances of Serbia's continued territorial integrity given by the NATO powers and reaffirmed (June 1999) in UN Security Council resolution 1244.</p>
<p> 
<br/></p>
<p>At the same time, it is also difficult to see how <a href='Serbia'>Serbia</a> would consent to recognizing Kosovar independence, and without Serbia's approval, recognition of Kosovar independence would be extremely problematic under <a href='international law'>international law</a> as it would be a violation of the principles of <a href='territorial integrity'>territorial integrity</a> and <a href='non-interference in internal affairs'>non-interference in internal affairs</a>. The most likely outcome is the indefinite continuation of the current situation.</p>
