In 1040-1041, a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire was staged that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantines restored control..[][<\/p>

<p>]In[ <a href='1166'>]1166[<\/a>], a Serbian nobleman from[ <a href='Zeta (state)|Zeta'>]Zeta (state)|Zeta[<\/a>],[ <a href='Stefan Nemanja'>]Stefan Nemanja[<\/a>], the founder of the[ <a href='NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja'>]NemanjiÄ|House of Nemanja[<\/a> ]ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor[ <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>]Manuel I Comnenus[<\/a>]. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the[ <a href='Sitnica'>]Sitnica[<\/a> ]river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in[ <a href='1183'>]1183[<\/a>], Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the[ <a href='Hungarians'>]Hungarians[<\/a> ]after the death of[ <a href='Manuel I Comnenus'>]Manuel I Comnenus[<\/a> ]in[ <a href='1180'>]1180[<\/a>], marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo..[][<\/p>

The people that followed him were mostly[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]and[ <a href='Albanians'>]Albanians[<\/a> ]abandoned - but they were likely followed by other ethnic groups.

It is also noted that some[ <a href='Serbs'>]Serbs[<\/a> ]adopted[ <a href='Islam'>]Islam[<\/a>], while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanianians, adopting their culture and even language..[][<\/p>

Over 300 Albanian leaders from vilayets of Kosovo, Manastir, Shkodra and Yannina gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was initially supported by the Ottoman Sultan. The Ottomans then turned against the League, which was pursuing Albanian intersts in 1881. The Ottoman Army started fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl FrashÃ«ri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decrete that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularely the Albanians. In 1910, an[ <a href='Albanian'>]Albanian[<\/a> ]uprising spread from[ <a href='Prishtina'>]Prishtina[<\/a> ]and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State..[][<\/p>

At the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1912 presided over by Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, the Kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro were acknowledged sovereignty over Kosovo, with the condition that the local population is not harmed.

]After the[ <a href='Dayton'>]Dayton[<\/a> ]Agreement in 1995, some Albanians organized into the[ <a href='Kosovo Liberation Army'>]Kosovo Liberation Army[<\/a> ](KLA), employing guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and civilians.

On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of[ <a href='Racak'>]Racak[<\/a>].

After more than a month of negotations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has beeen argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation)..[][<\/p>
<p>]This triggered a 78-day[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a> ]campaign in[ <a href='1999'>]1999[<\/a>]. At first limited to military targets in Kosovo proper, the bombing campaign was soon extended to cover targets all over Yugoslavia, including bridges, power stations, factories, broadcasting stations, post offices, and various government buildings..[][<\/p>

]During the conflict, several thousand were killed, the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed. An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict, including military personnel and civilians, primarily as a result of the ground war in Kosovo between the KLA and the Yugoslav military, Serbian police and Serbian paramilitary forces. Some 3000 people are still missing,of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma[&lt;]ref[&gt;]http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/world\/europe\/781310.stm[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;].

]With the arrival of NATO, a large number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 100,000 by the UNHCR. Around 120,000 remain in Kosovo.

According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated.
