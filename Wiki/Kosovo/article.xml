'''Kosovo''' &lt;!--Please leave the following language order as Albanian followed by Serbian: this is alphabetical and as neutral as we can get; Albanian is also the primary language of the region--&gt;({{lang-sq|Kosova}} or ''Kosovë'', {{lang-sr|Косово}}, ''Kosovo'') is a self-proclaimed republic in [[southeastern Europe]], disputed by [[Serbia]]. It borders Serbia proper to the north, [[Montenegro]] to the east, and [[Albania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the south. It has a population of just over two million people, predominantly ethnic [[Albanians]], with smaller populations of  [[Serbs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Romani people]], [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorani]]s, [[Bosniaks]], and other ethnic communities. [[Priština]] is the capital and largest city.

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]] placed Kosovo under the authority of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), with security provided by the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR), and legally reaffirmed Serbia's [[sovereignty]] over the region. After [[Kosovo status process|UN-sponsored negotiations]] failed to reach a consensus on an acceptable [[constitutional status of Kosovo|constitutional status]], [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|Kosovo's provisional government]] unilaterally [[declaration of independence|declared independence]] from [[Serbia]] on [[17 February]] [[2008]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7249034.stm BBC News:  Kosovo MPs proclaim independence - February 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;, terming itself as the '''Republic of Kosovo''' ({{lang-sq|Republika e Kosovës}}, {{lang-sr|Република Косово}}, ''Republika Kosovo''), and receiving [[International reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|partial international recognition]] as a [[state]] (notably from the [[United States]] and some major [[Europe]]an countries).

The Serbian government regards Kosovo as a Serbian province under the name of '''Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija''' ({{lang-sr|Аутономна покрајина Косово и Метохија}}, ''Autonomna pokrajina Kosovo i Metohija'', also Космет, ''Kosmet''; {{lang-sq|Krahina Autonome e Kosovës dhe Metohisë}}), and is supported in this view by some other states, including [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Serbian governance in the region, however, is virtually nonexistent.

Among countries that wield the [[United Nations Security Council veto power]], the United States, United Kingdom, and France have all recognised Kosovo, and Russia and the People's Republic of China refuse to recognise Kosovo. This leads to a stalemate in the Security Council on whether or not to recognise Kosovo.

{{Refimprove|section|date=February 2008}}
===Ancient and medieval periods===
Kosova was known in antiquity and up to the 19th century as [[Dardania]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts/AH1883.html Arthur Evans, “Some Observations on the Present State of Dardania,” R. Elsie ed., ''Albanian History'']&lt;/ref&gt; (from Albanian word ''dardhë'' = pear; literally ''Pearland'') after the Illyrian tribe [[Dardani]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''Kosovo: A Short History'' (UP: New York, 2003) 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Stipcevic, ''Iliri'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirdita, ''Studime dardane'', pp.7-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papazoglu, ''Central Balkan Tribes'', pp.210-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katicic, ''Ancient Languages'', pp.179-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papazogu, &quot;Dardanska onomastika&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Historical sources mention a Kingdom of Dardania as early as 4th century B.C., while Greek and Roman historians describe its people as hardworking, hospitable, and of an advanced civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Bep Jubani et al., ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent kings include Longarius, Mononius, and Bato, who engaged in frequent wars against Macedon and achieved numerous successful victories.&lt;ref&gt;Bep Jubani et al., ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an account of wars with the Celts. Dardania was well-known for its gold resources and ancient writings describe the Dardani as fine producers of jewels. Major cities included Damastion, Naissus ([[Nis]]), Scupi ([[Skopje]]), and Ulpiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shqiperia.com/kat/m/shfaqart/aid/71.html Historia e Shqipërisë, “Mbretëria e Dardanisë: Territori dhe popullsia,” Shqiperia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dardania was conquered by Rome in the late 1st century B.C. and gave the [[Roman Empire]] some of its most outstanding emperors, including [[Constantine the Great]]. Christianity was spread in the country in its initial phases, while individuals like [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Niketas Dardani]], authored the early Christian hymnals.

With the [[Migration Period|Barbaric Invasion]] between the 5th and 8th century, Dardania became a safe haven for the preservation of the Illyrian culture and language as well as the heritage of the Romanized population.  Between the 9th and 11th century, Dardania was snatched from the [[Byzantine Empire]] by the [[Bulgarian Empire]]. Later it was briefly returned to the Byzantines, before the [[Serbia]]n invasion in the late 12th century. In the next 100 years, the Serbs established their rule over Dardania, imposing a heavy burden in the Western Christian population, whose identity was threatened by the Serbian state-church. During this time, the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was moved to [[Peja]],&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''Kosovo: A Short History'' (UP: New York, 2003) 50.&lt;/ref&gt; while the natural resources allowed for a further expansion of the Serbian state. With the creation of a Serbian empire in the 14th century, Dardania became a central geographical unit of the Serbian state. This fact and the presence of the Serbian Orthodox church in the region has given rise to a romantic vision in Serbian culture regarding Kosova as the “cradle of the Serbian civilization.”{{fact|date=February 2008}}
In 1389, in the famous [[Battle of Kosovo]] a coalition of Christian armies including Albanians, Bosnians and Hungarians, led by the Serbian prince [[Lazar Hrebljanovic]] was defeated by the [[Ottoman Turks]], who finally took control of the territory in [[1455]].  During the intervening years, some Serbian lords were granted the power to rule as vassals of the Ottoman Sultan, who used them as a means of quelling liberation movements from any of the Balkan nations.  In the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]], the Turkish vassal, [[Vuk Brankovic]], barricaded the Albanian leader [[Gjergj Kastrioti]] from joining with the Hungarian army of [[Janos Hunyadi]], who faced a weighty defeat.

===Ottoman rule===
{{seealso|Vilayet of Kosovo}}
{{seealso|History of Ottoman Serbia}}
[[Image:Kosovo02.png|left|thumb|200px|Kosovo Vilayet, 1875-1878.]]
The Ottoman conquest of Kosovo was a major achievement for the Turks, as the Kosovar rich minerals would prove a great asset to their empire. The establishment of Ottoman institutions in Kosova brought about a new era. The Catholic population was in a constant state of disfavor with the new regime, while the Orthodox Church had been placed under the protection of Ottoman monarchs. This status of the Roman Catholic Church led to a systematic oppression of its members. Likewise, heavy religiously-selective taxation and threats to national assimilation by forceful absorption into the Serbian Orthodox Church led to a mass conversion of Christian Albanians into [[Islam]]. The new religion was embraced by approximately two-thirds of the Albanians, while it slightly improved their status by preserving their national identity before the Serbian peril, it did not rule out the struggle against the Ottoman regime.

Kosovo was an ordinary sight of defiant people who fought against the new regime in quest for their national liberty. As a result, many Albanian highlanders retained some autonomy and were allowed to apply their customary law (mainly the [[Kanun|Kanun of Lekë Dukagjini]]). Nevertheless, examples of Ottoman attempts to give an end to this practice are abundant; the heroine Nora of the Kelmendi clan earned a distinguished place in Kosovar history by assassinating the Ottoman leader in Kosovo.

During the Ottoman period, nonetheless, there was recorded a great amount of endeavors to promote the Albanian language and culture. The Catholic cleric who authored the earliest known Albanian book, [[Gjon Buzuku]], is believed to have been born in Kosovo. Moreover, the Catholic bishop, [[Pjetër Bogdani]], a native of Kosovo, published his classic ''Band of the Prophets'' in 1686, and later headed the anti-Ottoman movement. His engagement in the national cause culminated in 1689, when he raised a 20,000-member army comprised of Christian and Muslim Albanians, who joined the Austrians in their war against Turkey. The campaign resulted in a brief liberation of Kosovo, but after a plague breakout among Austrians and Kosovars, the Turks soon recovered all their lost areas. Bogdani himself died in December 1689, while his remains were inhumanely exhumed by Turks and Tatars and fed to dogs.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors1/AA1-01.html Pjetër Bogdani, biography by R. Elsie, ''Albanian Literature'']&lt;/ref&gt; The loss had a negative impact on the wellbeing all inhabitants of Kosovo, whose liberation was not realized in an 18th-century Austrian endeavor either.

=== Modern era ===
In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of &quot;Old Serbia&quot; was discussed, as the [[History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia]] itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory. Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the 1876–1877 Serbo-Turkish war and the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish war are now known as '[[muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher]]' (which means 'refugee', from [[Arabic]] [[muhajir]]). Their descendants still have the same surname, ''Muhaxheri''. It is estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] between 1876 and 1912 by Turks and their Albanian allies, especially during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottoman War]] in 1897.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of Priština and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] under civil Serbian control,  and outside the jurisdiction of the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a response, the Albanians formed the nationalistic and conservative [[League of Prizren]] in [[Prizren]] later the same year. Over three hundred Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a [[Greater Albania|unified Albanian people]] under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure on the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army began fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl Frashëri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well. By the end of the 19th century the [[Albanians]] replaced the [[Serbs]] as the dominant people in Kosovo.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decree that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians. In 1910, an [[Albanian]] uprising spread from Priština and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However, at that time Serbs have consisted about 25% of the whole Vilayet of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian rule along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

==== Balkan Wars ====
[[Image:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Boundaries on the Balkans after the [[First Balkan War|First]] and [[Second Balkan War]].]]

In [[1912]], during the [[Balkan Wars]], most of Kosovo was taken by the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]], while the region of [[Metohija]] ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Dukagjini Valley'') was taken by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. This was described by [[Leon Trotsky]], who was a reporter for the ''Pravda'' newspaper at the time. The Serbian authorities planned a recolonization of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.elsie.de/pdf/B2002GatheringClouds.pdf Elsie, R. (ed.) (2002): &quot;''Gathering Clouds. The roots of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Early twentieth-century documents''&quot;]. Dukagjini Balkan Books, Peja (Kosovo, Serbia). ISBN 9951-05-016-6&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous colonist Serb families moved into Kosovo, equalizing the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs. Many Albanians fled into the mountains and numerous Albanian and Turkish houses were razed. The reconquest of Kosovo was described as retribution for the 1389 [[Battle of Kossovo]]. At the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1912 presided over by Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, the Kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro were granted sovereignty over Kosovo.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

==== World War I ====
In the winter of [[1915]]-[[1916]], during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw a large exodus of the Serbian army which became known as the ''Great Serbian Retreat''. Defeated and worn out in battles against Austro-Hungarians, they had no other choice than to retreat, as Kosovo was occupied by [[Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] and [[Austro-Hungarians]]. The Albanians joined and supported the [[Central Powers]]. As opposed to Serbian schools, numerous Albanian schools were opened during the 'occupation' (the majority Albanian population considered it a liberation). Allied ships were awaiting Serbian people and soldiers at the banks of the Adriatic sea and the path leading them there went across Kosovo and Albania. Tens of thousands of soldiers died of starvation, extreme weather and Albanian reprisals{{Fact|date=February 2008}} as they were approaching the [[Allies]] in [[Corfu]] and [[Thessaloniki]], amassing a total of 100,000 dead retreaters.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Transported away from the front lines, the Serbian army managed to treat many wounded and ill soldiers and get some rest. Refreshed and regrouped, it decided to return to the battlefield. In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. During Serbian control of Kosovo, the Serbian Army committed atrocities against the population in revenge.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Serbian Kosovo was unified with Montenegrin Metohija as Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia. After World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] (Serbo-Croatian: ''Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca'', Albanian: ''Mbretëria Serbe, Kroate, Sllovene'') on [[1 December]] [[1918]], gathering territories gained in victory.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

==== Kingdom of Yugoslavia and World War II ====
The 1918&amp;ndash;1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In the Kingdom, Kosovo was split into four counties—three being a part of the entity of Serbia: Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since [[26 April]] [[1922]] split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Rascia]] and [[Zeta]]. In 1921 the Albanian elite lodged an official protest of the government to the League of Nations, claiming that 12,000 Albanians had been killed and over 22,000 imprisoned since 1918 and seeking a [[Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands]]. As a result, an armed ''Kachak'' resistance movement was formed whose main goal was to unite Albanian-populated areas of the Kingdom to Albania.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia lasted until the [[World War II]] [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion of 1941.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

The greatest part of Kosovo became a part of [[Italy|Italian]]-controlled [[Albania|Fascist Albania]], and smaller bits by the [[Greater Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany|German]]-occupied [[Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]]. During the fascist occupation of Kosovo by Albanians, until [[August]] [[1941]] alone, over 10,000 [[Serbs]] were killed and between 80,000 and 100,000 [[Serbs]] were expelled, while roughly the same number of Albanians from Albania were brought to settle in these Serbian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Krizman, Serge. &quot;Massacre of the innocent Serbian population, committed in Yugoslavia by the Axis and its Satellite from April 1941 to August 1941&quot;. Map. ''Maps of Yugoslavia at War'', Washington, [[1943]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mustafa Kruja, the [[Prime Minister]] of [[Albania]], was in Kosovo in [[June]] [[1942]], and at a meeting with the Albanian leaders of Kosovo, he said: &quot;''We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo be – the area be cleansed of them and all Serbs who had been living there for centuries should be termed colonialists and sent to concentration camps in Albania. The Serb settlers should be killed.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanović, Dimitrije. &quot;The Book on Kosovo&quot;. 1990.

Prior to the surrender of [[History of Italy|Fascist Italy]] in [[1943]], the German forces took over direct control of the region. After numerous uprisings of [[Partisans]] led by [[Fadil Hoxha]], Kosovo was liberated after [[1944]] with the help of the Albanian partisans of the [[Comintern]], and became a province of [[Serbia]] within the [[Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

==== Kosovo in the second Yugoslavia ====
[[Image:SAP Kosovo.png|thumb|230px|right|[[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]] of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Socialist Serbia]] inside [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]], 1974-1990.]]

The province was first formed in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area to protect its regional [[Albanians|Albanian]] majority within the [[History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia]] as a member of the [[SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, [[Josip Broz Tito]], but with no actual autonomy. After Yugoslavia's name change to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Serbia's to the [[History of Serbia|Socialist Republic of Serbia]] in [[1953]], Kosovo gained internal autonomy in the 1960s.

Tito pursued a policy of weakening Serbia, as he believed that a &quot;Weak Serbia equals a strong Yugoslavia&quot;. In the [[1974]] constitution, the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]'s government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles — President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a ''de facto'' Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. (Similar rights were extended to [[Vojvodina]]. In Kosovo [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] were defined as official languages on the provincial level. 

In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition as a Republic within the Yugoslav Federation, while extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. &lt;!-- Tito's regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. What does this mean? --&gt; The ethnic balance of Kosovo tilted as the number of [[Albanians]] tripled, rising from almost 75% to over 90%, but the number of [[Serbs]] barely increased, dropping from 15% to 8% of the total population. Even though Kosovo was the least developed area of the former Yugoslavia, the living and economic prospects and freedoms were far greater than under the totalitarian [[Enver Hoxha|Hoxha]] regime in Albania.

Beginning in March [[1981]], Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots &quot;involving 20,000 people in six cities&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19810419&quot;&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, &quot;One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Serbs and Yugoslav state authorities resulting in increased emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters19860527&quot;&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, &quot;Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;csm19860728&quot;&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, &quot;Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19870627&quot;&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, &quot;Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1986]], the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the [[SANU Memorandum]], a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): [http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum]. GIP Kultura. Belgrade.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some think that [[Slobodan Milošević]] used the discontent reflected in the SANU memorandum for his own political goals, during his rise to power in [[Serbia]] at the time.

Milošević was initially sent to meet with local Communist party officials. However a large demonstration of Serbian nationalists had been organized to coincide with Milošević's arrival.  When the demonstrators broke thru the police cordon the police got out their batons and the situation began to get ugly. At this point Milošević went to a window and in an emotional moment promised the local Serbs that &quot;No one is allowed to beat you.&quot; This newsbite was then seen on evening news and catapulted a then unknown Milošević to the forefront of the current debate about the problems on Kosovo. Afterwards he agreed to listen to representatives of the Serbs who aired their grievances - this continued to the next morning. &lt;ref&gt;Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare. Ed Jasminka Udovićka and James Ridgeway p82&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to save his skin, Milošević fought back and established a political [[coup d'état]]. He gained effective leadership and control of the Serbian Communist party and pressed forward with the one issue that had catapulted him to the forefront of the political limelight, which was Kosovo. Thus, by the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. [[Slobodan Milošević]] pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters19880730&quot;&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, &quot;Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kosovo and the breakup of Yugoslavia ====
Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s. In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, complained about mistreatment from the Albanian majority.  Miloševic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.  In 1987, Serbian President Ivan Stambolić sent Milošević to Kosovo to &quot;pacify restive Serbs in Kosovo.&quot; On that trip, Milošević broke away from a meeting with ethnic Albanians to mingle with angry Serbians in a suburb of Pristina. As the Serbs protested they were being pushed back by police with batons, Milošević told them, &quot;No one is allowed to beat you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/kosovo/stories/past/milosevic/ |title=Wily Milosevic makes the most of the worst |author=CNN |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was later seen as pivotal to Milošević's rise to power.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

On June 28, 1989, Milošević delivered a speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]], held at [[Gazimestan]]. Many think that this speech helped Milošević consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, &quot;What's next for Slobodan Milošević?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.  Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On [[July 2]] [[1990]], an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations but was not recognized internationally. With an ''80%'' turnout, ''98%'' voted for Kosovo to be independent.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

==== Kosovo War ====

One of the events that contributed to Milošević's rise of power was the ''Gazimestan Speech'', delivered in front of 100,000 Serb citizens at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]], held at [[Gazimestan]] on 28 June, 1989. Soon afterwards the autonomy of Kosovo was reduced. After [[Slovenia]]'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, Milošević used the seat to attain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

Albanians organized a peaceful separatist movement. State institutions and elections were boycotted and separate Albanian schools and political institutions were established. On [[July 2]], [[1990]] Kosovo Parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, the [[Republic of Kosova]], this was only recognized by Albania. In September of that year, the parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of [[Kaçanik]], adopted the ''Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo''. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations but was not recognized internationally. With an 80% turnout, 98% voted for Kosovo to be independent.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

With the events in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Croatia]] coming to an end, the Serb government started relocating Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia all over Serbia, including in Kosovo. In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make room for the refugees.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

After the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995, some Albanians organized into the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), employing guerrilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities were forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement devised by [[Richard Holbrooke]], [[OSCE]] observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. 
On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of [[Racak]]. The victims had been executed by Serb forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1812847.stm |title=Racak massacre haunts Milosevic trial |author=Jon Silverman |date=14/02/02 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm |title=Yugoslav Government War Crimes in Racak |author=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to the German newspaper &quot;Berliner Zeitung,&quot; Finnish pathologist Helena Ranta, who was assigned by the EU as the head of the team sent to investigate the Racak incident &quot;...expressed lack of comprehension regarding the work of the UN's Hague tribunal in the case of the so-called massacre of Racak.&quot; Ranta also criticized that &quot;...Indications of serious fighting between Serbian soldiers and Albanian fighters on the night of 15th to 16th of January, 1999, in the Racak area had been inadequately pursued.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosovo.net/erpkiminfo_jan04/erpkiminfo19jan04.html |title=&quot;Racak case&quot; in public focus again |author=KiM Info-Service |date=19/01/04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at [[Rambouillet]]. After more than a month of negotiations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has been argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).

This triggered a 78-day [[NATO]] campaign in [[1999]]. At first limited to military targets in Kosovo proper, the bombing campaign was soon extended to cover targets all over Yugoslavia, including bridges, power stations, factories, broadcasting stations, post offices, and various government buildings.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

During the conflict roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo, several thousand were killed (the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed). An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict. Some 3,000 people are still missing, of which 2,500 are Albanian, 400 Serbs and 100 Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/781310.stm |title=3,000 missing in Kosovo |author=KiM Info-Service |date=07/06/00}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the worst massacres against civilian Albanians occurred after NATO started the bombing of Yugoslavia. Cuska massacre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/kosovo/cuska/cuska_frameset.html |title=The Massacre |author=American RadioWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podujevo massacre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/balkans/crimesandcourage.html |title=Massacre at Podujevo, Kosovo |author=Carol Off |date=29/03/04 |publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velika Krusa massacre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/inside_kosovo/velika_krusa.stm |title=Case Study: Velika Krusa |author=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the massacres committed by Serbian army, police and paramilitary.

During the Kosovo War, Serbs also engaged in a deliberate campaign of cultural destruction and rampage. According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated. The report concludes that most mosques were deliberately set on fire with no sign of fighting around the area. Among numerous other things, the following important objects were destroyed because they represented Albanian as well as Muslim and Catholic cultures:

* Sinan Pasha Mosque in Prizren
* The Prizren League Museum
* The Hadum Mosque complex in Gjakova (Serbian: Djakovica)
* The historic bazaars in Gjakova and Peć (Albanian: Peja)
* The Roman Catholic church of St. Anthony in Gjakova
* Two old Ottoman bridges, Ura e Terzive (Terzijski most) and Ura e Tabakeve (Tabacki most), near Gjakova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/kosovo/herscherriedlmayer.htm |title=Architectural Heritage in Kosovo: A Post-War Report |author=Andrew Herscher and Andras Riedlmayer |publisher=Harverford College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, several dozens of Serbian monasteries and churches were destroyed, burned or robbed by Albanians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.yu/kosovo/raspeto/default.htm |title=RASPETO KOSOVO: Kompletno i dopunjeno izdanje |author=Projekat Rastko |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; after NATO campaign by the end of 1999.

After the war ended, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1244 that placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration ([[UNMIK]]) and authorized [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Almost immediately, returning Kosovo Albanians attacked Kosovo Serbs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pri%C5%A1tina#Kosovo_War_and_aftermath], causing some 200,000-280,000&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2002/coe-kos-16oct.pdf Kosovo: The Human Rights Situation and the Fate of Persons Displaced from Their Homes (.pdf)] &quot;, report by [[Alvaro Gil-Robles]], [[Council of Europe]] Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, October 16, 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Serbs and other non-Albanians&lt;ref&gt;Note: Including Roma, Egyptian, Ashkalli, Turks and Bosniaks. – Sources:

Many displaced Serbs are afraid to return to their homes, even with [[UNMIK]] protection.  Around 120,000-150,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, but are subject to ongoing harassment and discrimination.

According to Amnesty International, the presence of peacekeepers in Kosovo led to an increase in the [[trafficking of women]] for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3686173.stm |title=Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade' |author=BBC News |date=06/05/04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |title=Kosovo: Trafficked women and girls have human rights |author=Amnesty International |authorlink=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html |title=Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade' |author=The Guardian |date=07/05/04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Kosovo that established the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister.  Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year).  UNMIK oversaw the establishment of a professional, multi-ethnic Kosovo Police Service.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} 

In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War.  The [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004]] was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots.  Serbian men had unleashed their dogs on young Albanian boys, two of whom died.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Protesting, the Kosovo Albanians mobs burned hundreds of Serbian houses, Serbian Orthodox Church sites (including some medieval churches and monasteries) and UN facilities. Kosovo Police established a special investigation team to handle cases related to the 2004 unrest and according to Kosovo Judicial Council by the end of 2006 the 326 charges filed by municipal and district prosecutors for criminal offenses in connection with the unrest had resulted in 200 indictments: convictions in 134 cases, and courts acquitted eight and dismissed 28; 30 cases were pending. International prosecutors and judges handled the most sensitive cases.&lt;ref&gt;U.S State Department Report, published in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kosovo status negotiations ====
{{main|Kosovo status process}}
International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]].  The [[UN]]-backed talks, lead by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] &quot;, ''BBC News'', October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the [[Security Council]], was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29/06/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date=09/07/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=30/03/07 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on [[20 July]] [[2007]], having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a &quot;[[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]]&quot; consisting of negotiators from the [[European Union]] (Wolfgang Ischinger), the [[United States]] (Frank Wisner)  and [[Russia]] (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina.  Despite Russian disapproval, the [[U.S.]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[France]] appeared likely to recognize Kosovar independence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2209907,00.html |title=Bosnian nightmare returns to haunt EU |author=Simon Tisdall |date=13/11/07 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanian leaders was postponed until the end of the Serbian presidential elections (4 February 2008). Most EU members and the US had feared that a premature declaration could boost support in Serbia for the ultra-nationalist candidate, Tomislav Nikolic.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6386467.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Kosovo}}
[[Image:UTkosovo rel small 92.jpg|thumb|left|Physical map of Kosovo.]]
[[Image:Kosovo map.png|thumb|right|Political map of Kosovo.]]
Kosovo has an area of 10,887 [[square kilometers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/home.html |title=Welcome to the Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals (ICMM), Kosovo |author=Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4,203 [[square mile|sq&amp;nbsp;mi]]) and a population of about 2.2 million. The largest cities are [[Pristina]], the capital, with an estimated 600,000 inhabitants, [[Prizren]] in the south west with a population of 165,000, [[Peć]] in the west with 154,000, and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] in the north with 110,000. Five other towns have populations in excess of 97,000. 

The climate in Kosovo is continental, with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. There are two main plains in Kosovo. The [[Metohija]] basin is located in the western part of the Kosovo, and the Plain of Kosovo occupies the eastern part.

Much of Kosovo's terrain is mountainous. The [[Šar Mountain]]s are located in the south and south-east, bordering [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. This is one of the region's most popular tourist and skiing resorts, with [[Brezovica]] and Prevalac as the main tourist centres. Kosovo's mountainous area, including the highest peak [[Đeravica]], at 2656&amp;nbsp;m above sea level, is located in the south-west, bordering Montenegro and Albania. 

The [[Kopaonik]] mountain is located in the north, bordering. The central region of [[Drenica]], Carraleva and the eastern part of Kosovo, known as [[Golak]], are mainly hilly areas. There are several notable rivers and lakes in Kosovo. The main rivers are the [[White Drin]], running towards the [[Adriatic Sea]], with the [[Erenik]] among its [[Tributary|tributaries]]), the [[Sitnica]], the [[Morava]] in the Golak area, and [[Ibar River|Ibar]] in the north. The main lakes are Gazivoda (380 million m³) in the north-western part, Radonic (113 million m³) in the south-west part, Batlava (40 million m³) and Badovac (26 million m³) in the north-east part.

==Politics and governance==
{{main|Politics of Kosovo}}
{{seealso|United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|Provisional Institutions of Self-Government}}
{{Politics of Kosovo}}
In 1999, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.

In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG). The PISG replaced the [[Joint Interim Administrative Structure]] (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs.  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.

According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.  

The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Miloševic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named &quot;Ora.&quot;  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.  

In November 2001, the [[OSCE]] supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.  

After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in [[Ramush Haradinaj]] (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.  

[[Image:Coat_of_arms_of_the_PISG_of_Kosovo.svg|thumb|right|100px|The [[Approved logo of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|Approved Logo]] of the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]].]]
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander [[Agim Ceku]].  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected [[Fatmir Sejdiu]], a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. Slaviša Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds] &quot;, Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM] &quot;, Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.

[[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|Parliamentary elections]] were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, [[Hashim Thaçi]] who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo|Albanian Democratic Party]], and stated his intention to declare independence. Thaci is likely to form a coalition with current [[Fatmir Sejdiu|President Fatmir Sejdiu]]'s [[Democratic League of Kosovo|Democratic League]] which was in second place with 22 percent of the vote. The turnout at the election was particularly low with most Serbs refusing to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=454473&amp;lng=1 EuroNews: Ex-guerrilla chief claims victory in Kosovo election].

== Health ==

Access to health care is free for all residents of Kosovo. Currently there is no health insurance, however, the Ministry of Health is in the process of preparing a legislative infrastructure, which is scheduled to be implemented in 2008.

There are hospitals in all major cities. A total of 6 regional hospitals provide tertiary health care, and family centers in small municipalities.

Medical Education is available at the University Clinical Center of Kosovo (UCCK), in Pristina.

Kosovo has one of the most under-developed economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at [[Euro|€]]1,565 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=Kosovo Brief 2006 |author=The World Bank |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, international sanctions, poor external commerce and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=World Bank Mission in Kosovo |author=The World Bank |date=2006/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.

Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 |title=May finds Kosovo with 50% unemployed |author=eciks |date=04/05/06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNMIK introduced ''de-facto'' an external trade regime and customs administration on [[September 3]], [[1999]] when it set customs border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported in Kosovo face a flat 10% customs duty fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyUSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html |title=Doing Business in Kosovo |author=U.S. Commercial Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; These taxes are collected from all Tax Collection Points installed at the borders of Kosovo, including those between Kosovo and  Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf |format=PDF |title=External Trade and Customs |author=Economic Reconstruction and Development in South East Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed Free Trade Agreements with [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/globe-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=123&amp;nav_id=37090 |title=Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement |author=B92 |authorlink=B92 |date=02/10/06 |publisher=mrt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNMIK and Bosnia and Herzegovina Initial Free Trade Agreement |author=EU in Kosovo |date=17/02/06 |publisher=UNMIK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyUSA&quot;/&gt;

The [[Republic of Macedonia]] is Kosovo's largest import and export market (averaging €220 million and €9 million, respectively), followed by Serbia-Montenegro (€111 million and €5 million), Germany and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVO/147270-1121700806276/20953280/Kosovo_Economic_Briefing_april.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo Monthly Economic Briefing: Preparing for next winter |author=The World Bank |date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and used by UNMIK and the government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php |title=Invest in Kosovo |author=EU in Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Serbian dinar]] is used in the Serbian-populated parts.

The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm |title=Brussels offers first Kosovo loan |author=BBC News |date=03/05/05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach.

== Demographics ==

{{main|Demographic history of Kosovo}}

According to the Kosovo in Figures 2005 Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo in figures 2005 |author=UNMIK |publisher=Ministry of Public Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |author=BBC News |date=23/12/05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=Regions and territories: Kosovo |author=BBC News |date=20/11/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2 million in the following ethnic proportions (but many pre-1999 Kosovar Serbs and individuals from other ethnic groups originally from Kosovo now live in [[Central Serbia]], about 250.000-350.000). The estimate from 2000-2002-2003 goes (a 1,900,000 strong population):
* 92% [[Albanians]]  
* 4% [[Serbs]]
* 2% [[Bosniaks]] and [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorans]]
* 1% [[Roma people|Roma]]
* 1% [[Turkish people|Turks]]

[[Islam]] is the predominant faith, professed by most of the majority ethnic Albanian population; the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities; and some of the Roma/[[Ashkali]]/[[Egyptians (Balkans)|Egyptian]] community, although religion is not a significant factor in public life. Religious rhetoric was largely absent from public discourse in Muslim communities, mosque attendance was low, and public displays of conservative Islamic dress and culture were minimal. The Serb population, estimated at 100,000 to 120,000 persons, is largely [[Serbian Orthodox]]. Approximately 3 percent of ethnic Albanians are [[Roman Catholic]]. Catholic communities are concentrated around Catholic churches in [[Prizren]], [[Klina]], and [[Gjakova]]. [[Protestant]]s make up less than 1 percent of the population and have small populations in most cities, with the largest concentration located in Pristina. There are no synagogues or [[Jewish]] institutions; there are reportedly two families whose members have Jewish roots. The number of [[atheist]]s or those who do not practice any religion are difficult to determine, and estimates are largely unreliable.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1 |title=Religion in Kosovo |author=International Crisis Group |date=31/01/01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90198.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2007 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71405.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2006 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia and Montenegro (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the largest population growth in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml Albanian Population Growth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Kosovo/demographic-explosion.html Demographic explosion in Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; The people’s growth rate in Kosovo is 1.3%. Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew 4.6 times. If growth continues at such a pace, based on some estimations, the population will be 4.5 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosova-Hotels, Prishtinë]&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''See also: [[List of Albanians#Musicians|Albanian and Kosovo, Albanian musicians]], [[Music of Kosovo]], [[Music of Serbia]], [[List of Serbian musicians]]
Although in Kosovo the music is diverse (influenced to an extent by the cultures of the various regimes who controlled the region), authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. Albanian music is characterized by the use of the ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''. In Kosovo, [[folk]] music is very popular alongside modern music. There are a number of folk [[singers]] and ensembles (both Albanian and Serbian). [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at [[universities]] (at the [[University of Prishtina#Albanian university|University of Priština Faculty of Arts]]  and the [[University of Pristina#Serbian university|University of Priština at Kosovska Mitrovica]]  [[Faculty of Arts of Priština|Faculty of Arts]]) and several pre-[[college]] [[List of pre-college music schools|music school]]s

There are some notable music festivals in Kosovo:
* ''Rock për Rock'' - contains [[Rock (music)|rock]] and [[Heavy Metal music|metal]] music
* ''Polifest'' - contains all kinds of genres (usually [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and commercial [[Pop (music)|pop]])
* ''Showfest'' - contains all kinds of genres (usually [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and commercial [[Pop (music)|pop]])
* ''Videofest'' - contains all kinds of genres

Kosovo Radiotelevisions like ''RTK'', ''21'' and ''KTV'' have their musical charts.

===Sport===
Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 &quot;Law on Sport&quot; passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national Olympic Committee, regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for sports clubs. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.

Federations that have so far gained membership or recognition by their international governing body:
* [[Handball Federation of Kosovo]]
* [[Table Tennis Federation of Kosovo]]

Federations that have not yet gained international recognition:
* [[Basketball Federation of Kosovo]]
* [[Football Federation of Kosovo]] and the [[Kosovo national football team]]
* [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo]]
