In the 4th to 3rd centuries BC, it was the territory of the <a href='Thraco-Illyrian'>Thraco-Illyrian</a> tribe of the <a href='Dardani'>Dardani</a>, forming part of the kingdom of <a href='Illyria'>Illyria</a>. Illyria was conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and made the Roman province of <a href='Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum'>Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum</a> in 59 BC. The Kosova region became part of <a href='Moesia Superior'>Moesia Superior</a> in AD 87. The <a href='Slavic migrations'>Slavic migrations</a> reached the Balkans in the 6th to 7th century. The area was absorbed into the <a href='First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire'>First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire</a> in the 850s, where Christianity and Slavic culture was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018. As the center of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, it often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of <a href='Rascia'>Rascia</a> conquered it by the end of the 11th century. 
The Kosova region became part of <a href='Moesia Superior'>Moesia Superior</a> in AD 87. The <a href='Slavic migrations'>Slavic migrations</a> reached the Balkans in the 6th to 7th century.

The zenith was reached with the formation of a <a href='Serbian Empire'>Serbian Empire</a> in 1346, which after 1371 transformed from a centralized absolutist medieval monarchy to a feudal realm.

In 1690, the <a href='Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ'>Serbian Patriarch of PeÄ</a> <a href='Arsenije III'>Arsenije III</a> led 37,000 predominantly Serbian families out of Kosova. More migrations of Orthodox Christians from the Kosova area continued throughout the 18th century. 
In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the <a href='Patriarchate of PeÄ'>Patriarchate of PeÄ</a> and the position of Christians in Kosova deteriorated, including full imposition of <a href='jizya'>jizya</a> (taxation of non-Muslims).

<p>The province was first formed in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosova-Metohian Area to protect its regional <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> majority within the <a href='People's Republic of Serbia'>People's Republic of Serbia</a> as a member of the <a href='SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia'>SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia</a> under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, <a href='Josip Broz Tito'>Josip Broz Tito</a>. After Yugoslavia's name change to the <a href='Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> and Serbia's to the <a href='Socialist Republic of Serbia'>Socialist Republic of Serbia</a> in 1953, Kosova gained limited internal autonomy in the 1960s. In the 1974 constitution, the <a href='Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosova'>Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosova</a>'s government received more powers, including the highest governmental titles â President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a <em>de facto</em> Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. (Similar rights were extended to <a href='Vojvodina'>Vojvodina</a>). In Kosova <a href='Serbo-Croatian'>Serbo-Croatian</a>, <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> and <a href='Turkish language|Turkish'>Turkish language|Turkish</a> were defined as official languages on the provincial level. Du to high birthrates the number of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90% despite immigration from both sides in search of a better life in the West. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, as many Serbs departed from Kosova as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents of alleged harassment from their Albanian neighbors. While there was tension, charges of "genocide" and planned harassments have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosova's autonomy.  For example in 1986 ""<a href='http://books.google.com/books?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=genocide+false+Kosova&amp;sig=kmSTVjt9oW2TpXi7kUVw81mjN7o the Serbian Orthodox Church published an official, though false, claim that Kosova Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'Genocide''>8</a>.

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosova throughout the 1980s.
The 1986  <a href='SANU Memorandum'>SANU Memorandum</a> warned that Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): <a href='http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>10</a>.

On <a href='June 28'>June 28</a> <a href='1989'>1989</a>, MiloÅ¡eviÄ delivered a speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the <a href='Battle of Kosova'>Battle of Kosova</a>, held at <a href='Gazimestan'>Gazimestan</a>. Many think that this speech helped MiloÅ¡eviÄ consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;<em>The Economist</em>, June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, "What's next for Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ?"&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosova's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter, Kosova Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosova.  On <a href='July 2'>July 2</a> <a href='1990'>1990</a>, an unconstitutional Kosova parliament declared Kosova an independent country, the <em>Republic of Kosova</em>.   The Republic of Kosova was formally disbanded in 2000 when its institutions were replaced by the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> established by the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosova'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosova</a> (UNMIK).

In 1998, Western interest had increased and the Serbian authorities were compelled to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement devised by <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>Richard Holbrooke</a>, <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> observers moved into Kosova to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosova. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}</p>
<p>The Serbs then began to escalate the conflict, using military and paramilitary forces in another <a href='ethnic cleansing'>ethnic cleansing</a> campaign this time against the Kosovar Albanians.  An estimated 300,000 refugees were displaced during the winter of 1998, many left without adequate food or shelter, precipitating a humanitarian crisis and calls for intervention by the international community.</p>

In 1999, <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244</a> placed Kosova under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosova's future status. This Resolution entrusted the <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosova'>United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosova</a> (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosova, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no official role in governing Kosova and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosova. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosova's <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</a> (PISG). The PISG replaced the <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>Joint Interim Administrative Structure</a> (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosova has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosova Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosova shall have a 120-member Kosova Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosova Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosova Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosova.</p>
<p>However, since 1999, the Serb-inhabited areas of Kosova, such as <a href='North Kosova'>North Kosova</a> have remained <em>de facto</em> independent from the Albanian-dominated government in <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a>.  They continue to uses Serbian national symbols and participate in Serbian national elections, which are boycotted in the rest of Kosova.  Serb-inhabited regions also boycott Kosova elections.

In February 2003, the Serb areas united to form the  <strong>Union of Serbian Districts and District Units of Kosova and Metohija</strong> in a meeting in Kosovska Mitrovica, which has since served as the <em>de facto</em> "capital."  The Union's President is <a href='Dragan VeliÄ'>Dragan VeliÄ</a>. There is also a central governing body, the Serbian National Council for Kosova and Metohija (SNV).

<p>According to <a href='http://www.eciks.org/english/invest.php?action=total_invest&amp;main_id=13 ECIKS'>50</a> from 2001 to 2004 Kosova received $3,2&amp;nbsp;billion of foreign aid. International donnor conference is to be held in Switzerland in June or July 2008. Until now EU pledged 2&amp;nbsp;billion â¬, $350 mil by USA. Serbia also pledged 120&amp;nbsp;million â¬ to Serb's enclaves in Kosova.</p>
<a name="Energy_sector"></a><h3>Energy sector</h3><p>At 14,700 Mt, Kosova has the worldâs fifth-largest proven reserves of <a href='lignite'>lignite</a>, a type of <a href='coal'>coal</a>. The lignite is distributed across the Kosova, Dukagjin and Drenica basins, although mining has so far been restricted to the Kosova basin.  Coal reserves are found in two main basins and are currently being mined in the coal mines of <a href='Bardh open-cast coal mine'>Bardh open-cast coal mine</a> and <a href='Mirash open-cast coal mine'>Mirash open-cast coal mine</a>.</p>
<p>Energy sector presents a major potential for development of Kosova's economy. There are two large coal-fired electrical power plants named "Kosova A" and "Kosova B" and the project to build a larger 2100-MW coal-fired power plant is underway with expected completion in 2012.</p>
<a name="Mining"></a><h3>Mining</h3><p>Kosova has <a href='lead'>lead</a>-<a href='zinc'>zinc</a>-<a href='silver'>silver</a> mines of Artana (Novo Brdo), Belo Brdo, Stan Terg and Hajvalia mines, and the Crnac mine. During the lead-zinc-silver exploitation at Farbani Potok (Artana-Novo Brdo), about 3 Mt of high-grade <a href='halloysite'>halloysite</a> was discovered. Halloysite is an aluminosilicate clay mineral used as a raw material for <a href='porcelain'>porcelain</a> and <a href='bone china'>bone china</a>. This is only one of five known exploitable deposits of this very high-value (US$140-450/t) clay, the other four being in New Zealand, Turkey, China and Utah, US. Current world production is estimated at 150,000 t/y. There is also <a href='nickel'>nickel</a> to be found in Kosova and the largest working mine is in Ãikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica (District of UroÅ¡evac). There are significant deposits of <a href='chromium'>chromium</a>, <a href='bauxite'>bauxite</a> and <a href='magnesite'>magnesite</a>, but mining has been stalled since 1999.</p>
<a name="Unemployment"></a><h3>Unemployment</h3><p>A major issue in Kosova that is undermining Kosova's development is unemployment. Official unemployment rate stands at 40%. <a href='The World Bank'>The World Bank</a> states that even with 6 per cent annual growth (twice what Kosova manages at the moment), it would take ten years to cut unemployment by half, from 40 to 20 per cent. {{Fact|04/28/08|date=April 2008}} Persistent unemployment, in particular among the young, will fuel frustration, which would be bad for political peace.<a href='http://centreforeuropeanreform.blogspot.com/2008/02/Kosova-economic-dilemma.html'>51</a> The unemployment rate among young people age under 25, whom account of approximately 50% of Kosova's population, is much higher, approximately 60%.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVA/Country%20Home/21541686/KosovaPAvol1.pdf: Kosova Poverty Assessment'>52</a> ", World Banl, <a href='3 October'>3 October</a> <a href='2007'>2007</a>&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a system of Kosovars going abroad as migrant workers has emerged.  Approximately one out of five Kosovar households report having had a family member search for work abroad.&lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVA/Country%20Home/21541686/KosovaPAvol1.pdf: Kosova Poverty Assessment'>53</a> ", World Banl, <a href='3 October'>3 October</a> <a href='2007'>2007</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  Kosova has the youngest population in Europe {{Fact|04/28/08|date=April 2008}}, so in coming years, with significant development of educational sector on Kosova, the current unemployment situation could be improved. {{Fact|04/28/08|date=April 2008}}</p>

<p>Kosova comprises a relatively small geographical area but is nevertheless densely covered by numerous Serb Orthodox churches and monasteries.</p>
<p> 
At 1.3% per year, ethnic Albanians in Kosova have the fastest rate of growth in population in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml Albanian Population Growth'>57</a>&lt;/ref&gt;  Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew to 460% of its original size.  If growth continues at such a pace, the population will reach 4.5&amp;nbsp;million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;<a href='http://Kosova-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosova-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosova-Hotels, PrishtinÃ«'>58</a>&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>By contrast, from <a href='Demographics_of_Kosova#World_War_II-1968|1948'>Demographics_of_Kosova#World_War_II-1968|1948</a> to <a href='Demographics_of_Kosova#1989-1999:_Centralized_Yugoslav_Control|1991'>Demographics_of_Kosova#1989-1999:_Centralized_Yugoslav_Control|1991</a>, the Serb population of Kosova increased by but twelve percent (one third the growth of the population in the rest of Serbia).
