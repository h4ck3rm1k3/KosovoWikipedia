{{History of Kosovo}}
'''Kosovo''' ({{lang-sq|Kosova, Kosovë}}; {{lang-sr|Косово or Косово и Метохија, ''Kosovo'' or ''Kosovo i Metohija''}}) is a disputed region in the [[Balkans]]. 

&lt;!-- Note: Below, the exact sentence with alternative city names was first discussed on the talk page, proposed, then inserted here as consensus. Please do not alter it without discussing it first on the talk page. Thank you. --&gt;

Kosovo is landlocked and is bordered by [[Central Serbia]] to the north and east, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the south, [[Albania]] to the west, and [[Montenegro]] to the northwest. The largest city and the capital of Kosovo is [[Pristina]] (alternatively spelled Prishtina or Priština), while other cities include [[Peć]] (Peja), [[Prizren]], [[Đakovica]] (Gjakova) and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] (Mitrovica).

Kosovo was a part of the lands of [[Thraco-Illyrian]] tribes, then of the [[Roman empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]], and [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] empires. In 1912 it was divided between [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], which later became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. After the [[Kosovo War]] and 1999 [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7990984.stm&lt;/ref&gt; the territory came under the interim administration of the United Nations ([[UNMIK]]). '''Eulex''' has now assumed the role previously occupied by '''UNMIK'''. The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) is the largest civilian mission ever launched under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). The central aim is to assist and support the Kosovo authorities in the rule of law area, specifically in the police, judiciary and customs areas. The mission is not in Kosovo to govern or rule. It is a technical mission which will monitor, mentor and advise whilst retaining a number of limited executive powers. EULEX works under the general framework of United Nations Security Resolution 1244 and has a unified chain of command to Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?id=2&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2008, the [[Assembly of Kosovo]] declared Kosovo's independence as the Republic of Kosovo. As of 18 May 2009, its independence is [[diplomatic recognition|recognised]] {{Kosovorecognition|by|UN member states}} and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan (country)|Taiwan]]). 

==Name==
{{main|Names of Kosovo}}
''Kosovo'' (Косово, {{IPAlink|ˈkɔsɔvɔ}}&lt;!--PLEASE VERIFY VOWELS--&gt;) is the Serbian neuter possessive adjective of ''kos'' (кос) &quot;[[Turdus merula|blackbird]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinionleaders.htmlplanet.com/koskosova.html &quot;The name Kosovo&quot;]. Dr John-Peter Maher, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics, [[Northeastern Illinois University]]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] for ''Kosovo Polje'' &quot;field of the blackbirds&quot;, the [[Kosovo Field|site]] of the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo Field]]. The name of the field was applied to [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|an Ottoman province]] created in 1864.

The region currently known as &quot;Kosovo&quot; became an administrative region in 1946, as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946-1974)|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]]. In 1974, the compositional &quot;Kosovo and [[Metohija]]&quot; was reduced to simple &quot;Kosovo&quot; in the name of the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], but in 1990 was renamed back to [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1990-1999)|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].

The entire region is commonly referred to in [[English language|English]] simply as ''Kosovo'' and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''{{lang|sq|Kosova}}'' ([[Albanian language#Grammar|definite form]], {{IPAlink|kɔˈsova}}) or ''{{lang|sq|Kosovë}}'' ([[Albanian language#Grammar|&quot;indefinite&quot; form]], {{IPAlink|kɔˈsoːv}}). In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], a distinction is made between the eastern and western areas; the term ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo}}'' ({{lang|sr|Косово}}) is used for the eastern part, while the western part is called &quot;[[Metohija]]&quot; ({{lang|sr|Метохија}}).

Since Kosovo declared independence, it is now also referred to as &quot;The Republic of Kosovo&quot; in English, though &quot;Kosovo&quot; is still the most common name used.

==History==
{{main|History of Kosovo|20th century history of Kosovo}}

The formation of the Republic of Kosovo is a result of the turmoils of the [[disintegration of Yugoslavia]], particularly the [[Kosovo War]] of 1998 to 1999, but it is suffused with issues dating back to the [[rise of nationalism in the Balkans]] during the last part of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]] in the 19th century, [[Albanian nationalism|Albanian]] vs. [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian]] nationalisms in particular, the latter notably surrounding the [[Battle of Kosovo]] eponymous with the Kosovo region. 

===Prehistoric and Medieval period (Neolithic period to 1455)===
{{main|Prehistoric Balkans|Moesia Superior|History of Medieval Kosovo|First Bulgarian Empire|History of Medieval Serbia}}

During the [[Neolithic]] period, the region of Kosovo lay within the extent of the [[Vinča-Turdaş culture]].{{Fact|date=February 2009}} In the 4th to 1st centuries BC, the [[Dardani]] inhabited the region which roughly corresponds to modern Kosovo.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} The area was then conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and incoporated into the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87. The &quot;[[Slavic migrations]]&quot; reached the Balkans in the 6th to 7th century, whereby autochthonous peoples merged with the northern newcomers&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians. A Stipcevic. Noyes Press. Pg 76 ''the Slavs merged with these people (the Illyrians), thus preserving in their own identity remains of ancient Illyrians''&lt;/ref&gt;. Kosovo was absorbed into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 850s, where Christianity and a Byzantine-Slavic culture was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018. As the centre of Slavic resistance to Constantinople in the region, it often switched between Serbian and Bulgarian rule on one hand and Byzantine on the other until the Serb principality of [[Rascia]] conquered it by the end of the 11th century. Such takeovers had little impact on the local populace, since it mereley represented a changing of one Balkan Christian dynasty by another. Fully absorbed into the Serbian Kingdom until the end of the 12th, it became the secular and spiritual centre of the [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbian medieval state]] of the [[House of Nemanjić|Nemanjić]] dynasty in the 13th century, with the Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church in [[Peć]], while [[Prizren]] was the secular centre.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} The zenith was reached with the formation of a [[Serbian Empire]] in 1346, which after 1371 transformed from a centralised absolutist medieval monarchy to a feudal realm.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} Kosovo became the hereditary land of the [[House of Branković]] and [[Vučitrn]] and [[Priština|Pristina]] flourished.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

In the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo]], Ottoman forces defeated a coalition of Serbs, Albanians, and Bosnians[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=4173] led by the Prince [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]]. Soon after parts of Serbia accepted Turkish vassalage and Lazar's daughter was married to the Sultan to seal peace. In 1402, a [[Serbian Despotate]] was raised and Kosovo became its richest territory, famous for mines.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}
The local House of [[Vuk Branković|Branković]] came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under [[Vuk Branković]], with the temporary fall of the [[History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate]] in 1439.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} By 1455, it was finally and fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

===Ottoman Kosovo (1455 to 1912)===
{{main|History of Ottoman Kosovo}}
{{see|Vilayet of Kosovo|History of Ottoman Serbia}}

Kosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]'').

Kosovo, like Serbia, was occupied by the Austrian forces during the Great War of 1683–1699.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/habsbott16831699.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}

Following the invitation from [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/00000384/01/Todorovicweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in 1690, the [[Serbian Patriarch of Peć]] [[Arsenije III]] claimed that he led 37,000 predominantly [[Serbs|Serbian families]] out of Kosovo and other areas into [[Habsburg Empire|Austria]]&lt;ref&gt;The Serbs. Sima Cirkovic. Blackwell Publishing. Pg 144 ''Patriarch Arsenije III clained that 30, 000 people followed him (on another occasion the figure was 40, 000)''&lt;/ref&gt;. More migrations of Orthodox Christians from the Kosovo area preceded and followed throughout the 18th century during the [[Great Serb Migrations]]&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 115 ''The great migrations that had begun earlier continued after the establishment of Ottoman rule in territories that had formerly been part of the Serbian state''&lt;/ref&gt;, in addition to the forcible removal of Christian subjects by the Turks as slaves and war booty&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 115 '' Prior to the final conquest, the Turks often took inhabitants as slaves, frequently to Asia Minor&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Patriarchate of Peć]] and the position of Christians in Kosovo deteriorated, including full imposition of [[jizya]] (taxation of non-Muslims). In contrast, many Albanian chiefs converted to Islam and gained prominent positions in the Turkish regimen.&lt;ref name=&quot;hupchik&quot;&gt;The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism. Dennis Hupchik&lt;/ref&gt; On the whole, &quot;Albanians had little cause of unrest&quot; and &quot;if anything, grew important in Ottoman internal affairs&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hupchik&quot;/&gt;, and sometimes persecuted Christians harshly on behalf of their Turkish masters[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=4173]. The final result of four and a half centuries of Muslim rule was a marked decline in the previously dominant Slavic Christian demographic element in Kosovo. The cause of this demographic shift was manifold. The outward movement of Christians was accompanied by an inward migration of Albanians&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 ''In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since the Middle Ages with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the islamisation of urban centers, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control.&lt;/ref&gt; and other Islamic peoples such as Circassians (with notable anti-Christian sentiments), who often served as auxiliary troops for the Turks.[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=4173]. In addition, during Ottoman rule, the distinction between Serb and Albanian was not always clear cut. As Islam became the dominant religion, some Serbs converted to Islam and lost their Serbian identity, and were rather referred to as &quot;Turks&quot; or &quot;[[Albanisation|Albanians]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 208-09, citing 19th century author Jakov Ignjatovic: ''A Serb without his religious rites and customs is not a Serb''&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century, there was a &quot;[[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening]]&quot; of [[ethnic nationalism]] throughout the Balkans. The ethnic [[Albanian nationalism]] movement was centred in Kosovo. This, unfortunately, systemetised the underlying ethnic tensions into a broader struggle of Christian Serbs against Muslim Albanians. [http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=4173]

In 1871, a Serbian meeting was held in [[Prizren]] at which the possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of &quot;Old Serbia&quot; was discussed, as the [[History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia]] itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that left the cities of Pristina and [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] under civil Serbian control, and outside Ottoman jurisdiction, while the rest of Kosovo remained under Ottoman control.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} In the same year ethnic Albanians formed the [[League of Prizren]], pursuing political aspirations of unifying the Albanian people and seeking autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, although certain Albanian factions wished for a continuance of the Ottoman Empire&lt;ref&gt;Cirkovic. Pg 244 ''since islamicized Albanians represented a significan portion of the Ottoman armed forces and administration, they did not give up the Empire easily''&lt;/ref&gt;. The League of Prizren ruled Kosovo until 1881, when it was quashed by Ottoman troops.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

===20th century===
{{main|20th century history of Kosovo}}

====Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Second World War====
The [[Young Turk]] movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularly the Albanians.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} In 1910, an [[Albania]]n uprising spread from Pristina and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June 1911.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}
In 1912, during the [[Balkan Wars]], most of Kosovo was captured by the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]], while the region of [[Metohija]] ({{lang-sq|Dukagjini Valley}}) was taken by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. Serbian authorities promoted creating new Serb settlements in Kosovo as well as the assimilation of Albanians into Serbian society.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schabnel 2001 20&quot;&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur, Ramesh (eds). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, Collective Action, and International Citizenship. New York: The United Nations University, 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous colonist Serb families moved into Kosovo, equalising the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs.

Kosovo's status within Serbia was finalised the following year at the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos145.htm Treaty of London, 1913].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1915–16, during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Austria-Hungary]].
In 1918, the Serbian Army pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.

Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia (Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Rascia]] and [[Zeta]]. In 1929, the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]].

In order to change the ethnic composition of Kosovo, between 1912 and 1941 a large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo was undertaken by the Belgrade government.{{Fact|date=February 2009}} Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Schabnel 2001 20&quot; /&gt;  Albanians and other Muslims were forced to emigrate, mainly with the [[land reform]] which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.&lt;ref name= &quot;daskalovski&quot;&gt;Daskalovski, Židas.

In 1941, Kosovo and Yugoslavia became involved in [[World War II]] after the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia 1941. Large parts of Kosovo became a part of [[Albania under Italy|Italian-controlled Albania]], other parts went to [[Tsardom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied [[Serbia (1941-1944)|Military Administration of Serbia]]. The Italian Fascist regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] with its expansionist and [[Irredentism|irredentist]] aims on both Albania and Yugoslavia exploited the nationalist sentiment amongst Albanians to gain favour of the Albanian population for the Italian-run protectorate which ruled Albania, and thus encouraged the establishment of a [[Greater Albania]] which included large portions of Kosovo which was achieved in the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands of Serbs were driven out of Kosovo during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht(ed); Thakur, Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1944 wartime [[Bujan]] conference the Kosovar communist resistance leaders passed a resolution on the postwar assignment of Kosovo to Albania, but their opinion was later disregarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;malcolm&quot;/&gt; After numerous uprisings of [[Partisan (military)|Partisans]] led by [[Fadil Hoxha]], Kosovo was liberated after 1944 with the help of the Albanian partisans of the [[Comintern]] and became a province of [[Serbia]] within the [[Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

====Kosovo in Communist Yugoslavia====
{{main|Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1946-1974)|Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo}}

The province first took shape with its present borders in 1945 as the Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area. Prior to world War II, no entity by the name of Kosovo had existed where-as in the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a ''[[vilayet]]'' with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to [[Albania]], or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]], or [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]] (including its previous capital, [[Skopje]]) with another part in the [[Sandžak]] region of [[Central Serbia]].

The violent oppression and forced expatriation of Albanians resumed, particularly after 1953, when [[Josip Broz Tito]] reached an agreement with Turkish Foreign Minister [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü]] to push Yugoslavian Albanians to declare themselves Turks and leave for Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;daskalovski&quot;/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=March 2009}}

The harsh repressions and expatriations came to an end when the 4th Plenum of the Central Committee of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] held at [[Brijuni]] (the ''Brioni Plenum'') in July 1966 ousted Yugoslavian Interior Minister and Vice President [[Aleksandar Ranković]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;&gt;[[Elsie, Robert]].

In February 1970 the [[University of Pristina]] was opened, providing higher education in Albanian.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;/&gt; In the 1974 constitution, the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]]'s government received more powers, including the highest governmental titles – President and Prime Minister and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a ''de facto'' Republic within the Federation, but remaining a Socialist Autonomous Province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia (similar rights were extended to [[Vojvodina]]). In Kosovo [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] were defined as official languages on the provincial level. Due to very high birth rates, the number of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents of alleged harassment from their Albanian neighbors. While there was tension, charges of &quot;genocide&quot; and planned harassments have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example in 1986 &quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=genocide+false+kosovo&amp;sig=kmSTVjt9oW2TpXi7kUVw81mjN7o the Serbian Orthodox Church published an official, though false, claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'Genocide']&quot;.

Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia along with human rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19810419&quot;&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, &quot;One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were brutally suppressed by the police and army, with many protesters arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;hdk&quot;/&gt; During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters19860527&quot;&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, &quot;Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;csm19860728&quot;&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, &quot;Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19870627&quot;&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, &quot;Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter-ethnic tensions continued to worsen in Kosovo throughout the 1980s.
The 1986 [[SANU Memorandum|Memorandum of the Serbian Academy]] warned that Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): [http://archive.serbianunity.net/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum].

On June 28, 1989, [[Slobodan Milošević]] delivered the [[Gazimestan speech]] in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. Many think that this speech helped Milošević consolidate his authority in Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', June 05, 1999, U.S. Edition, 1041 words, &quot;What's next for Slobodan Milošević?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=February 2009}}
In 1989, Milošević, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia and started cultural oppression of the ethnic Albanian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;&gt;Rogel, Carole.

In 1995 the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the [[Bosnian War]], drawing considerable international attention. However, despite the hopes of Kosovar Albanians, the situation in Kosovo remained largely unaddressed by the international community, and by 1996 the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), an ethnic [[Albanians|Albanian]] guerrilla group, had prevailed over the non-violent resistance movement and had started offering armed resistance to [[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] security forces, resulting in early stages of the [[Kosovo War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rama, Shinasi A.

''The International Journal of Albanian Studies'', 1 (1998), pp. 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, as the violence had worsened and displaced scores of Albanians, Western interest had increased. The Serbian authorities were compelled to sign a ceasefire and partial retreat, monitored by [[OSCE]] observers according to an agreement negotiated by [[Richard Holbrooke]]. However, the ceasefire did not hold and fighting resumed in December 1998. The [[Račak massacre]] in January 1999 in particular brought new international attention to the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;rogel&quot;/&gt; Within weeks, a multilateral international conference was convened and by March had prepared a draft agreement known as the [[Rambouillet Accords]], calling for restoration of Kosovo's autonomy and deployment of [[NATO]] peacekeeping forces. The Serbian party found the terms unacceptable and refused to sign the draft.

Since May 1999, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] has prosecuted crimes committed during the Kosovo War. Nine Serbian and Yugoslavian commanders have been indicted so far for [[crimes against humanity]] and violations of the [[laws or customs of war]] in Kosovo in 1999: Yugoslavian President [[Slobodan Milošević]], Serbian President [[Milan Milutinović]], Yugoslavian Deputy Prime Minister [[Nikola Šainović]], Yugoslavian Chief of the General Staff Gen. [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]], Serbian Interior Minister [[Vlajko Stojiljković]], Gen. [[Nebojša Pavković]], Gen. [[Vladimir Lazarević]], Deputy Interior Minister of Serbia [[Vlastimir Đorđević]] and Chief of the Interior for Kosovo [[Sreten Lukić]]. Stojiljković killed himself while at large in 2002 and Milošević died in custody during the trial in 2006. No final judgement concerning the other defendants has been produced so far. The indictment against the nine has alleged that they directed, encouraged or supported a campaign of terror and violence directed at Kosovo Albanian civilians and aimed at the expulsion of a substantial portion of them from Kosovo. It has been alleged that about 800,000 Albanians were expelled as a result. In particular, in the last indictment as of June 2006, the accused were charged with murder of 919 identified Kosovo Albanian civilians aged from one to 93, both male and female.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/cis/en/cis_milosevic_slobodan.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milutinovic/cis/en/cis_milutinovic_al_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/cis/en/cis_djordjevic_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/djordjevic/ind/en/dor-3rdai070119.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; Six KLA commanders were indicted in two cases: [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Isak Musliu]] and [[Haradin Bala]]&lt;ref&gt;Another Albanian was indicted together with them, but the charges against him were promptly withdrawn after his arrest, as he turned out not to be the person referred to in the indictment.&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as [[Ramush Haradinaj]], [[Idriz Balaj]] and [[Lahi Brahimaj]]. They were charged with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in Kosovo in 1998, consisting in persecutions, cruel treatment, torture, murders and rape of several dozens of the local Serbs, Albanians and other civilians perceived unloyal to the KLA. In particular, Limaj, Musliu and Bala were accused of murder of 22 identified detainees at or near the Llapushnik Prison Camp. In 2005 Limaj and Musliu were found not guilty on all charges, Bala was found guilty of persecutions, cruel treatment, murders and rape and sentenced to 13 years. The appeal chamber affirmed the judgements in 2007. In 2008 Ramush Haradinaj and Idriz Balaj were acquitted, whereas Lahi Brahimaj was found guilty of cruel treatment and torture and sentenced to six years. Notices of appeal are currently being considered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/cis/en/cis_limaj_et_al.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/haradinaj/cis/en/cis_haradinaj_al_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/cases/limaj/ind/en/lim-2ai040212e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 1999, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration ([[UNMIK]]) and authorised [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RESOLUTION 1244 (1999) |date=1999-06-17 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |accessdate=2008-02-19 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some 200,000-280,000, representing the majority of the Serb population, left when the Serbian forces left. There was also some looting of Serb properties and even violence against some of those Serbs and Roma who remained.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2002/coe-kos-16oct.pdf Kosovo: The Human Rights Situation and the Fate of Persons Displaced from Their Homes (.pdf)] &quot;, report by [[Alvaro Gil-Robles]], [[Council of Europe]] Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, October 16, 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The current number of [[internally displaced person]]s is disputed,&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], Critical Appraisal of Responsee Mechanisms Operating in Kosovo for Minority Returns, Pristina, February 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR), April 2000, Reversal of Fortune: Yugoslavia's Refugees Crisis Since the Ethnic Albanian Return to Kosovo, p. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2002/coe-kos-16oct.pdf Kosovo: The human rights situation and the fate of persons displaced from their homes (.pdf)] &quot;, report by [[Alvaro Gil-Robles]], [[Council of Europe]] Commissioner for Human Rights, Strasbourg, October 16, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;International Relations and Security Network (ISN): [http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_lausanne_reactions_id_1.pdf Serbians return to Kosovo not impossible, says report (.pdf)] , by Tim Judah, June 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; with estimates ranging from 65,000&lt;ref&gt;European Stability Initiative (ESI): [http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_53.pdf The Lausanne Principle: Multiethnicity, Territory and the Future of Kosovo's Serbs (.pdf)] , June 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; to 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Coordinating Centre of Serbia for Kosovo-Metohija: [http://www.kc.gov.yu/D-ENGLISH/dokumenti-eng/program-povratka-eng.html Principles of the program for return of internally displaced persons from Kosovo and Metohija] .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]]: 2002 Annual Statistical Report: Serbia and Montenegro, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] (USCRI): [http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=1624 Country report: Serbia and Montenegro 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; Many displaced Serbs are afraid to return to their homes, even with UNMIK protection. Around 120,000-150,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo, but are subject to ongoing harassment and discrimination due to physical threats for their safety.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7990984.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's political borders don't coincide with ethnic boundaries, and in 2001 [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|an ethnic insurgency]] surfaced in the neighbouring areas with ethnic Albanian majority, [[Preševo Valley]] in [[Central Serbia]] and the [[Polog Valley]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], but eased within several months.

In 2001, UNMIK promulgated a Constitutional Framework for Kosovo that established the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG), including an elected Kosovo Assembly, Presidency and office of Prime Minister. Kosovo held its first free, Kosovo-wide elections in late 2001 (municipal elections had been held the previous year).

In March 2004, Kosovo experienced its worst inter-ethnic violence since the Kosovo War. The [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004]] was sparked by a series of minor events that soon cascaded into large-scale riots.&lt;ref&gt;U.S State Department Report, published in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]]. The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] &quot;, ''BBC News'', October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the [[Security Council]], was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, had stated that it would not support any resolution which was not acceptable to both Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |author=Southeast European Times |date= 2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst most observers had, at the beginning of the talks, anticipated independence as the most likely outcome, others have suggested that a rapid resolution might not be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/985caa90-de5a-11db-afa7-000b5df10621.html?nclick_check=1 |title=A long reconciliation process is required |author=James Dancer |date=2007-03-30 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a &quot;[[Troika (triumvirate)|Troika]]&quot; consisting of negotiators from the [[European Union]] ([[Wolfgang Ischinger]]), the United States (Frank Wisner) and [[Russia]] (Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko) launched a new effort to reach a status outcome acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina. Despite Russian disapproval, the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France appeared likely to recognise Kosovar independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2209907,00.html |title=Bosnian nightmare returns to haunt EU |author=Simon Tisdall |date=2007-11-13 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A declaration of independence by Kosovar Albanian leaders was postponed until the end of the [[Serbian presidential election, 2008|Serbian presidential elections]] (4 February 2008).

Kosovo has not made a formal application for [[UN]] membership yet in view of a possible veto from Russia and China.

The [[European Union]] has no official position towards Kosovo's status, but has decided to deploy the [[European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo]] to ensure a continuation of international civil presence in Kosovo. {{As of|2008|4}}, most of the member-countries of [[NATO]], [[EU]], [[Western European Union|WEU]] and [[OECD]] have recognised Kosovo as independent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovothanksyou.com/stats.php&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008|10|9}}, all of Kosovo's immediate neighbour states except [[Serbia]] have recognised the declaration of independence.

The Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposes the declaration of independence, has formed the [[Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija]] in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue because it will not have an operative role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/06/30/feature-01 Kosovo Serbs convene parliament; Pristina, international authorities object (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is [[continental climate|continental]], with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. Most of Kosovo's terrain in mountainous, the highest peak is [[Đeravica]] ({{convert|2656|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=/}}). There are two main plain regions, the [[Metohija]] basin is located in the western part of the Kosovo, and the [[Plain of Kosovo]] occupies the eastern part. The main rivers of the region are the [[White Drin]], running towards the [[Adriatic Sea]], with the [[Erenik]] among its [[Tributary|tributaries]]), the [[Sitnica]], the [[South Morava]] in the [[Goljak]] area, and [[Ibar River|Ibar]] in the north. The biggest lakes are [[Gazivoda]], [[Radonjić]], [[Batlava]] and [[Badovac]].

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Kosovo belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Kosovo belongs to the ecoregion of [[Balkan mixed forests]].

39.1% of Kosovo is [[forested]], about 52% is classified as agricultural land, 31% of which is covered by pastures and 69% is arable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rec.org/REC/Publications/CountryReports/Kosovo.PDF Strategic Environmental Analysis of Kosovo].

Currently the 39,000 ha Šar Mountains National Park, established in 1986 in the [[Šar Mountains]] along the border with the Republic of Macedonia, is the only [[national park]] in Kosovo, although the [[Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park]] in the [[Prokletije]] along the border with Montenegro has been proposed as another one.&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;&gt;[http://www.ks-gov.net/akmm/dokumente/Kosovo-Biodiversity%20Assessment.pdf Kosovo: Biodiversity assessment].

Kosovo is under ''de facto'' governance of the Republic of Kosovo
except for [[North Kosovo]], which remains under ''de facto'' governance of Serbia.
The Republic of Kosovo is governed by legislative, executive and judicial institutions that derive from, and are set-up in, accordance with the [[Constitution of Kosovo]]. The last parliamentary and local elections were held in [[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|in 2007]]. [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] has undergone a significant reconfiguration, and no longer possesses the capacity, having handed over its few responsibilities to [[EULEX]], to govern in any meaningful fashion. It will, its head claims, function as a facilitator of contact between Kosovo and those states or organisations which do not recognise it yet. &lt;ref&gt;http://bsanna-news.ukrinform.ua/newsitem.php?id=7069&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Administration by the United Nations ===
{{main|United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|}}
In 1999, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no official role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.

In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]] (PISG). The PISG replaced the [[Joint Interim Administrative Structure]] (JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally supervised Kosovo Police Service.

According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.

However, since 1999, the Serb-inhabited areas of Kosovo, such as [[North Kosovo]] have remained ''de facto'' independent from the Albanian-dominated government in [[Priština]]. They continue to uses Serbian national symbols and participate in Serbian national elections, which are boycotted in the rest of Kosovo. Serb-inhabited regions also boycott Kosovo elections. The municipalities of [[Leposavić]], [[Zvečan]] and [[Zubin Potok]] are run by local Serbs, while the [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] municipality had rival Serb and Albanian governments until a compromise was agreed in November 2002.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

In February 2003, the Serb areas united to form the Union of Serbian Districts and District Units of Kosovo and Metohija in a meeting in Kosovska Mitrovica, which has since served as the ''de facto'' &quot;capital.&quot; The Union's President is [[Dragan Velić]]. There is also a central governing body, the Serbian National Council for Kosovo and Metohija (SNV). The President of SNV in North Kosovo is Dr [[Milan Ivanović (politician)|Milan Ivanović]], while the head of its Executive Council is [[Rada Trajković]].

Local politics in the Serb areas are dominated by the [[Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija]]. The Serbian List is led by [[Oliver Ivanović]], an engineer from Kosovska Mitrovica.

In February 2007 the Union of Serbian Districts and District Units of Kosovo and Metohija transformed into the Serbian Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija, presided by [[Marko Jakšić]], a hardline nationalist residing in the northern part of the divided city of Mitrovica.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansascity.com/659/story/684058.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L28603646.htm Reuters AlertNet - Kosovo Serbs convene parliament, rejecting new state&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly has strongly criticised what it calls &quot;the secessionist movements of the Albanian-dominated PISG Assembly of Kosovo&quot;{{Fact|date=July 2008}}. It has demanded unity of the Serb people in Kosovo, boycotted [[EULEX]], and announced massive protests in support of Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo. On 18 February 2008, day after Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, the Assembly declared it &quot;null and void&quot;.

Within Serbia, Kosovo is the concern of the Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija, currently led by [[Slobodan Samardzic]].

On the 26 July 2008, [[Lamberto Zannier]] the current head of UNMIK told the UN during a [[UNSC]] meeting regarding the situation of Kosovo that &quot;As a consequence of this stark divergence of paths taken by Kosovo, Serbian and Albanian communities, the spacing which UNMIK can operate has changed&quot; and that &quot;Since the entering into force of the Kosovo constitution, exercising my legal powers has become increasingly difficult in practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/26/2315306.htm?section=justin &quot;UN powerless in Kosovo: official&quot;] ''abc.net.au'' 26 July 2008 Link accessed 27/06/08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{main|Politics of Kosovo}}
===Parties===
The largest [[political parties in Kosovo]] are the centre-right [[Democratic League of Kosovo]] (LDK), which has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Miloševic's rule and was led by [[Ibrahim Rugova]] until his death in 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;ku&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.europeanforum.net/country.php/kosovo_update#4: Kosovo Update: Main Political Parties] &quot;, European Forum, 18 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and two parties having their roots in the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA): the centre-left [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]] (PDK) led by former KLA leader [[Hashim Thaçi]] and the centre-right [[Alliance for the Future of Kosovo]] (AAK) led by former KLA commander [[Ramush Haradinaj]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ku&quot;/&gt; Kosovo publisher [[Veton Surroi]] in 2004 formed the centre-left [[Reformist Party ORA]]. Kosovo Serbs formed the [[Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija]] (SLKM) in 2004 and won several seats, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ku&quot;/&gt; In 2006 Swiss-Kosovar businessman [[Behgjet Pacolli]], reputed to be the richest living Albanian, founded the [[New Kosovo Alliance]] (AKR), which came third in the 2007 elections.

===Provisional Institutions of Self-Government===
In November 2001, the [[OSCE]] supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13208.html: OSCE Mission in Kosovo - Elections] &quot;, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe&lt;/ref&gt; After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as President and [[Bajram Rexhepi]] (PDK) as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1846264.stm: Power-sharing deal reached in Kosovo] &quot;, BBC News, 21 February 2002&lt;/ref&gt; After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in [[Ramush Haradinaj]] (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005. Haradinaj was acquitted in April 2008. He was replaced by [[Bajram Kosumi]] (AAK).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3550401.stm: Timeline: Kosovo] &quot;, BBC News, 11 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander [[Agim Çeku]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4768680.stm: Former Rebel set to lead Kosovo] &quot;, BBC News, 2 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Çeku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs. The Kosovo Assembly elected [[Fatmir Sejdiu]], a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. Slaviša Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds] &quot;, Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM] &quot;, Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the Minister of Community and Return and the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare are ethnic Serbs, while the Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning is from Kosovo’s small Turkish minority.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ks-gov.net/pm/Ministritë/tabid/83/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kosovan parliamentary election, 2007|Parliamentary elections]] were held on 17 November 2007. After early results, [[Hashim Thaçi]] who was on course to gain 35 per cent of the vote, claimed victory for PDK, the [[Democratic Party of Kosovo]], and stated his intention to declare independence. Thaçi formed a coalition with current President [[Fatmir Sejdiu]]'s [[Democratic League of Kosovo|Democratic League]] which was in second place with 22 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7179850.stm: Kosovo gets pro-independence PM] &quot;, BBC News, 9 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The turnout at the election was particularly low.

===Republic of Kosovo===
{{see|Constitution of Kosovo}}
The Republic of Kosovo is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]]. The executive power is exercised by the [[Government of Kosovo]] led by the [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]]. Two or three of the ministers, depending on the size of the government, are required to be from the minorities. The [[President of the Republic of Kosovo]] is the head of state. The judiciary is independent. The legislative power is exercised by the single-chamber [[Assembly of Kosovo]] consisting of 120 members, 100 of them directly elected by the people for a four-year term and twenty seats reserved for representatives of the ethnic minorities only. The assembly elects the president for five years and approves the government.

A new constitution for the Republic of Kosovo was approved by the Parliament of the Republic of Kosovo, coming to force on June 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/06/15/kosovo.constitution.ap/ CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,1 Constitution of Kosovo - Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i-eG5b77lXRmme6EL1zWnRK5mdEQ AFP]; [http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12779731&amp;PageNum=0 ITAR-TASS]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign relations====

A 2,500-strong Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is to be trained by NATO and will be operational toward the end of 2009. The KSF will replace the Kosovar Protection Service (KPS) which had been made up mainly of former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), the separatist guerrillas who fought Serbia during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFUhM_dkT5VtQbsmvcICbBGZDF9Q&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule of law===
Following the [[Kosovo War]], due to the many weapons in the hands of civilians, law enforcement inefficiencies, and widespread devastation, both [[gjakmarrja|revenge killings]] and ethnic violence surged tremendously. The number of reported murders rose 80% from 136 in 2000 to 245 in 2001. The number of reported arsons rose 140% from 218 to 523 over the same period. UNMIK pointed out that the rise in reported incidents might simply correspond to an increased confidence in the police force (i.e., more reports) rather than more actual crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;unmikstat&quot;&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/civpol/statistics.htm UNMIK statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[UNODC]], by 2008, murder rates in Kosovo had dropped by 75% in five years&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/10585/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] report, March 2008. P. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of noted serious crimes increased between 1999 and 2000, since then it has been &quot;starting to resemble the same patterns of other European cities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unmikstat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwpr.net/?p=bcr&amp;s=f&amp;o=249549&amp;apc_state=henibcr2001 Kosovo Crime Wave], 17 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], the aftermath of the war resulted in an increase in the [[trafficking of women]] for sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3686173.stm Kosovo UN troops 'fuel sex trade'], [[BBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng Kosovo: Trafficked women and girls have human rights], Amnesty International.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade'], [[Guardian Unlimited]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] data, in 2000-2004, Kosovo was consistently ranked fourth or fifth among the countries of Southeastern Europe by number of human trafficking victims, after Albania, [[Moldova]], [[Romania]] and sometimes [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/site/myjahiasite/shared/shared/mainsite/published_docs/studies_and_reports/second_annual05.pdf Second Annual Report on Victims of Trafficking in South-Eastern Europe].

Residual landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. Caution when travelling in remote areas is advisable. &lt;ref&gt;https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/content/en/travel-advice/europe/12793683/FCO_TRV_ca_kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo is extremely vulnerable to [[organised crime]] and thus to [[money laundering]]. In 2000, international agencies estimated that Kosovo was supplying up to 40% of the heroin sold in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/mar/13/balkans&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[1997 unrest in Albania]] and the [[Kosovo War]] in 1998-1999 ethnic Albanian traffickers enjoyed a competitive advantage, which has been eroding as the region stabilises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[UNODC]] report, March 2008. P. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a 2008 report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], overall, ethnic Albanians, not only from Kosovo, supply 10 to 20% of the heroin in Western Europe, and the traffic has been declining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Balkan_study.pdf Crime and its impact on the Balkans and affected countries], [[UNODC]] report, March 2008.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Kosovo}}
[[Image:Bill Clinton Boulevard.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Clinton Boulevard]] in Pristina.]]
[[Image:BoroRamizi.jpg|thumb|The &quot;Palace of Youth&quot;.]]
Kosovo has one of the most under-developed economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at [[Euro|€]]1,750 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=Kosovo Brief 2006 |author=The World Bank |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kosovo had the largest exporting company (Trepca) in the Federal Republic of [[Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1585&amp;l=1&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia and received substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, international sanctions, poor external commerce and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=World Bank Mission in Kosovo |author=The World Bank |date=2006/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.

Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 |title=May finds Kosovo with 50% unemployed |author=eciks |date= 2006-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNMIK introduced an external trade regime and customs administration on September 3, 1999 when it set customs border controls in Kosovo.

Although, the Serbian dinar is still used in the Serbian-populated parts.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}&lt;!-- {{Fact date=April 2008}}--&gt;

The chief means of entry, apart form the main highway leading to the south to [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], is [[Priština International Airport|Pristina International Airport]].

===Trade and investment===
Kosovo's 2006 trade balance was total exports(FOB) $154mil and total imports(CIF) $1,612mil. {{Fact|date=May 2009}}

The [[Republic of Macedonia]] is Kosovo's largest import and export market (averaging €220&amp;nbsp;million and €9&amp;nbsp;million, respectively or 20% of whole Kosovo's trade), followed by Serbia (€111&amp;nbsp;million and €5&amp;nbsp;million app 12%), Germany (app 10% of total trade), China (app from 5-9% depending on season) and Turkey (app 6% of total imports). In total [[EU]]'s 27 Member States are Kosovo's biggest trade partner, 35% of all Kosovo's imports are coming from EU and app 50–60% of Kosovo's $150&amp;nbsp;million exports are going in EU27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVO/147270-1121700806276/20953280/Kosovo_Economic_Briefing_april.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo Monthly Economic Briefing: Preparing for next winter |author=The World Bank |month=April | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm |title=Brussels offers first Kosovo loan |author=BBC News |date= 2005-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach. {{Fact|date=May 2009}}

Kosovo has a reported foreign debt of 1,264&amp;nbsp;billion USD that is currently serviced by Serbia. {{Fact|date=May 2009}}

According to [[ECIKS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eciks.org/english/invest.php?action=total_invest&amp;main_id=13 ECIKS]&lt;/ref&gt; from 2001 to 2004 Kosovo received $3,2&amp;nbsp;billion of foreign aid. International donor conference is to be held in Switzerland in June or July 2008. Until now EU pledged €2&amp;nbsp;billion, $350 mil by USA. Serbia also pledged €120&amp;nbsp;million to Serb's enclaves in Kosovo.

===Energy and mining===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
At 14,700 Mt, Kosovo has the world’s fifth-largest proven reserves of [[lignite]], a type of [[coal]]. The lignite is distributed across the Kosovo, Dukagjin and Drenica basins, although mining has so far been restricted to the Kosovo basin. Coal reserves are found in two main basins and are currently being mined in the coal mines of [[Bardh open-cast coal mine]] and [[Mirash open-cast coal mine]].

Energy sector presents a major potential for development of Kosovo's economy. There are two large coal-fired electrical power plants named &quot;Kosovo A&quot; and &quot;Kosovo B&quot; and the project to build a larger 2100-MW coal-fired power plant is underway with expected completion in 2012.

Kosovo has [[lead]]-[[zinc]]-[[silver]] mines of Artana (Novo Brdo), Belo Brdo, Stan Terg and Hajvalia mines, and the Crnac mine. During the lead-zinc-silver exploitation at Farbani Potok (Artana-Novo Brdo), about 3 Mt of high-grade [[halloysite]] was discovered. Halloysite is an aluminosilicate clay mineral used as a raw material for [[porcelain]] and [[bone china]]. This is only one of five known exploitable deposits of this very high-value (US$140–450/t) clay, the other four being in New Zealand, Turkey, China and Utah, US. Current world production is estimated at 150,000 t/y. There is also [[nickel]] to be found in Kosovo and the largest working mine is in Çikatova (Dushkaja and Suke) and Gllavica (District of Uroševac). There are significant deposits of [[chromium]], [[bauxite]] and [[magnesite]], but mining has been stalled since 1999.

==Administrative regions==
Kosovo, for administrative reasons, is considered as consisting of seven districts{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.
[[North Kosovo]] maintains its own government, infrastructure and institutions by its dominant ethnic [[Serb]] population in the [[District of Kosovska Mitrovica]], viz. in the [[Leposavić]], [[Zvečan]] and [[Zubin Potok]] municipalities and the northern part of [[Kosovska Mitrovica]].

According to the Kosovo in Figures 2005 Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo in figures 2005 |author=UNMIK |publisher=Ministry of Public Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |author=BBC News |date=2005-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=churchesRegions and territories: Kosovo |author=BBC News |date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2&amp;nbsp;million with the following ethnic composition: [[Albanians]] 92%, [[Serbs]] 4%, [[Bosniaks]] and [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorans]] 2%, [[Turkish people|Turks]] 1%, [[Romani people|Roma]] 1%. [[CIA World Factbook]] estimates the following ratio: 88% [[Albanians]], 8% [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] and 4% other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanians, steadily increasing in number, have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, the earlier ethnic composition being disputed. Kosovo's political boundaries do not coincide with ethnic boundaries; Serbs form a local majority in [[North Kosovo]] and [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|several smaller enclaves]], while there are large areas with Albanian majority outside Kosovo in the neighbouring regions of former Yugoslavia, namely in the northwest of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and in [[Presevo]] of [[Central Serbia]].

At 1.3% per year, ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the fastest rate of growth in population in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml Albanian Population Growth]&lt;/ref&gt; Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew to 460% of its original size. If growth continues at such a pace, the population will reach 4.5&amp;nbsp;million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtinë]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, from [[Demographics of Kosovo#World War II-1968|1948]] to [[Demographics of Kosovo#1989-1999: Centralized Yugoslav Control|1991]], the Serb population of Kosovo increased by but twelve percent (one third the growth of the population in Central Serbia). The population of Albanians in Kosovo increased by three hundred percent in the same period{{ndash}} a rate of growth twenty-five times that of the Serbs in Kosovo. 

Since Kosovo's declaration of independence, Serbs have increasingly fled the region, causing anxiety for Kosovoan leaders and encouraging the claims of Serbian politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/DPI/LocalMed.nsf/0/FDF5C7A3B9C50ECAC125756D00402E66/$FILE/lmm010309.pdf UNMIK Headlines, March 1, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
The native dialect of the Kosovar Albanian population is [[Gheg Albanian]], although Standard [[Albanian language|Albanian]] is now widely used as an official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aln Albanian, Gheg A language of Serbia and Montenegro]. Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005. ''[[Ethnologue|Ethnologue: Languages of the World]]'', Fifteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Moosmüller &amp; Theodor Granser. [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=425300 The spread of Standard Albanian: An illustration based on an analysis of vowels]. ''Language Variation and Change'' (2006), 18: 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the draft [[Constitution of Kosovo]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is another official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovoconstitution.info/repository/docs/DraftConstitutionEnglish.pdf Draft Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Religion===
[[Islam]] (mostly [[Sunni]], with a [[Bektashi]] minority&lt;ref name=&quot;babuna&quot;/&gt;) is the predominant [[religion]] in Kosovo, brought into the region with the [[History of Ottoman Kosovo|Ottoman conquest]] in the 15th century and now followed by most of the ethnic Albanians, by the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities, and by some of the [[Romani people|Roma]]/[[Ashkali]]-&quot;[[Egyptians (Balkans)|Egyptian]]&quot; community.About three percent of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo remain [[Roman Catholic]] despite centuries of the Ottoman rule. The Serb population, estimated at 100,000 to 120,000 persons, is largely [[Serbian Orthodox]]. Kosovo is densely covered by numerous [[List_of_Serbian_Orthodox_monasteries#Kosovo-Metohia|Serb Orthodox churches and monasteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1 |title=Religion in Kosovo |author=International Crisis Group |date=2001-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90198.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2007 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71405.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2006 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia and Montenegro (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-ethnic relations between ethnic Albanian and Serb communities===
[[Image:Kosovo day.jpg|thumb|left|Serbs hold a strong cultural attachment to Kosovo and see it as the cultural heartland of Serbia, here a [[World War I]] poster - “Kossovo Day”  from 1916 inviting Allied solidarity with Serbia.]]

The relations between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian and Serb populations have been historically hostile due to nationalist rivalry which became strong after Serbia gained Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire in 1913 and after Albania became independent in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed). Kosovo and the Challenge of Humanitarian Intervention: Selective Indignation, Collective Action, and International Citizenship. New York: The United Nations University, 2001. Pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tito-era of communist rule in Yugoslavia, the ethnic Albanian and Serb populations of Kosovo were strongly irreconciliable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that ethnic Albanian and Serb peoples in Kosovo rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic prejudices,  stereotypes and mutual distrust between ethnic Albanians and Serbs have remained common for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The level of intolerance and separation between the ethnic Albanian and Serb communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer relations between each other.&lt;ref&gt;Schabnel, Albrecht; Thakur (ed), Ramesh (ed), 2001. Pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema and media===
{{main|Music of Kosovo}}
Although in Kosovo the music is diverse, authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. Albanian music is characterised by the use of the ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''. [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well-known in Kosovo and has been taught at several [[List of pre-college music schools|music schools]] and [[universities]] (at the [[University of Priština#Albanian university|University of Prishtina Faculty of Arts]] in [[Pristina]] and the [[Faculty of Arts of Priština|University of Priština Faculty of Arts]] at [[Kosovska Mitrovica]]).

===Sports===
{{seemain|Sport in Kosovo}}

Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 &quot;Law on Sport&quot; passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo|Olympic Committee]], regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for sports clubs. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.
