An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering from ethnic strife and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation.[&lt;]ref[&gt;]SANU (1986):[ <a href='http:\/\/www.balkan-archive.org.yu\/kosta\/memorandum\/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum'>]7[<\/a>].

]MiloÅ¡eviÄ was initially sent there as a member of the Communists party . Initially Milosevic did not talk to the serbian nationalists who were at that point demonstrating for rights and freedoms that had been denied to them. During these meetings he agreed to listen to their grievances. During the meeting, outside the building where this forum was taking place police started fighting the locals who had gathered there, mostly Serbs eager to voice their grievances. After hearing about the police brutality outside of the halls, MiloÅ¡eviÄ came out and in a emotional moment promised the local sebs that "Nobody would beat yo again." This news byte was then seen on evening news that catapulted then an unknown MiloÅ¡eviÄ to the forefront of the current debate about the problems on Kosovo..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]Since the 1974 Constitution, the Albanian controlled Kosovo communist officials in Kosovo had instituted a campaign of discrimination against non-Albanians, Serbs and other non-Albanians like the Roma, Turks and Macedonians, were fired from jobs and positions withing the regional government apparatus. These repressions and grievances had been swept conveniently under the rug with the pretense of "Brotherhood and Unity" policy instituted by then already late Josip Broz Tito.[  ]Any reasoning to the contradictory, was quickly silenced. To the party leaderships chargrin, Mr. Milosevic insisted on finding a solution for the Kosovo situation, he was quickly labeled as a reactionary..[][<\/p>
<p> 
]In order to save his skin, Milosevic fought back and established a political coup d'etat. He gained effective leadership and control of the Serbian Communist party and pressed forward with the one issue that had catapulted him to the forefront of the political limelight, which was Kosovo. This By the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder.[ <a href='Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ'>]Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ[<\/a> ]pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and[ <a href='Vojvodina'>]Vojvodina[<\/a>].[&lt;]ref name="reuters19880730"[&gt;]Reuters 1988-07-30, "Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom"[&lt;]\/ref.[][&gt;<\/p>

In particular, Kosovo's ethnic Serb community, a minority of Kosovo population, complained about mistreatment from the Albanian majority.[  ]Milosevic capitalized on this discontent to consolidate his own position in Serbia.[  ]In 1987, Serbian President Ivan Stambolic sent MiloÅ¡eviÄ to Kosovo to "pacify restive Serbs in Kosovo." On that trip, MiloÅ¡eviÄ broke away from a meeting with ethnic Albanians to mingle with angry Serbians in a suburb of Pristina. As the Serbs protested they were being pushed back by police with batons, MiloÅ¡eviÄ told them, "No one is allowed to beat you."[&lt;]ref[&gt;]http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/SPECIALS\/2000\/kosovo\/stories\/past\/milosevic\/[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;  ]This incident was later seen as pivotal to Milosevic's rise to power. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}.[][<\/p>
<p>]On June 28, 1989, Milosevic delivered a speech in front of a large number of Serb citizens at the main celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the[ <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>]Battle of Kosovo[<\/a>], held at[ <a href='Gazimestan'>]Gazimestan[<\/a>].

<p>]In 1989, MiloÅ¡eviÄ, employing a mix of intimidation and political maneuvering, drastically reduced Kosovo's special autonomous status within Serbia. Soon thereafter Kosovo Albanians organized a non-violent separatist movement, employing widespread civil disobedience, with the ultimate goal of achieving the independence of Kosovo.[  ]Kosovo Albanians boycotted state institutions and elections and established separate Albanian schools and political institutions. On[ <a href='July 2'>]July 2[<\/a> <a href='1990'>]1990[<\/a>], an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by Belgrade or any foreign states. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organizations but was not recognized internationally.

Violence escalated dramatically in 1998 through a cycle of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals.[  ]Both sides sometimes targeted civilians..[][<\/p>
<p>]In the fall of 1998, as the violence worsened and displaced more people, representatives of the international community brokered a ceasefire.[  ]Under an agreement negotiated by[ <a href='Richard Holbrooke'>]Richard Holbrooke[<\/a>], observers from the[ <a href='Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe'>]Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe[<\/a> ](OSCE) moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo..[][<\/p>

A draft agreement was prepared (the "[<a href='Rambouillet Accords'>]Rambouillet Accords[<\/a>]") that would have resulted in a NATO peacekeeping force deployed to Kosovo and the establishment of meaningful autonomy in Kosovo; the agreement also would have led to an international conference in three years to resolve the issue of Kosovo's status.[  ]After more than a month of talks, Yugoslavia refused to sign an agreement.[  ]Kosovo Albanians, after initially rejecting the accords because they did not promise immediate independence, eventually agreed..[][<\/p>
<p>]Largely as a result of the failure of the Raimbouillet conference, NATO launched a 78-day[ <a href='NATO'>]NATO[<\/a> ]aerial bombing campaign in the spring of[ <a href='1999'>]1999[<\/a> ]with the announced goal of compelling Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.[  ]Milosevic capitulated in June 1999, agreeing to the full withdrawal of all security forces from Kosovo..[][<\/p>

]During the conflict roughly a million ethnic Albanians fled or were forcefully driven from Kosovo, several thousand were killed (the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed). An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict.
