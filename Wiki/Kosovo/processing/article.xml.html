It is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute between Serbia and the province's majority ethnic <a href='Albanians|Albanian'>Albanians|Albanian</a> population. It lies within Serbia's traditional borders inside the <a href='Serbian-Montenegrin'>Serbian-Montenegrin</a> federation, but since the <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a> it has been administered by the <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> under the auspices of <a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a>. The province's final status has yet to be determined; talks on this issue are scheduled for later in <a href='2006'>2006</a>.</p>

<a name="History"></a><h2>History</h2><p><em>See <a href='History of Kosovo'>History of Kosovo</a>.</em></p>
<a name="Disputes_over_language,_culture_and_citizenship"></a><h2>Disputes over language, culture and citizenship</h2><p>The province is most widely known as 'Kosovo' and this has become the standard in international and United Nations usage. In <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> this name becomes 'Kosova', which is more often found within Kosovo and in official use by the Provisional Institutions, though both Albanian and Serbian are official languages. Wherever political and cultural sensitivity are particularly important, the international community will use 'Kosovo/Kosova' to describe the province and adopt a similar standard for many place names. Whilst the formal title 'Republic of Kosova' has fallen out of use with the integration of Kosovo Albanian politics into the UNMIK system, the formal Serbian title 'Kosovo i Metohija' remains in colloquial and official use in parts of Kosovo and in Serbia proper, where parallel institutions for Kosovo remain until final status is resolved.</p>
<p>The question of what to call the inhabitants of Kosovo collectively has also aroused some debate. The two words accepted by the <a href='Oxford English Dictionary'>Oxford English Dictionary</a> are "Kosovar" (borrowed from Albanian), the most widely used variant in English, by a long way, and "Kosovan" (using the English rules for <a href='demonym'>demonyms</a>) much less used. As Kosovo has no formal statehood, current international usage is to refer to Kosovo <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and Kosovo <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a>. Most of the Albanian-descended community in Kosovo would prefer the use of Kosovar or Kosovan because of the attendant political overtones, whilst the Serb minority continue to think of themselves as Serb or Serbian (from Kosovo).</p>
<p>As for language and citizenship, so for cultural and political symbols. The province has never had an official flag of its own. The <a href='Flag of Albania|Albanian flag'>Flag of Albania|Albanian flag</a> is used unofficially by the Kosovo Albanian-dominated administration and the vast majority of Kosovo Albanians. The Serb-inhabited area of north Kosovo uses only the <a href='flag of Serbia'>flag of Serbia</a>, which is formally the flag of the whole of Serbia including Kosovo, although this usage is rejected by virtually all Kosovo Albanians.</p>
<a name="Politics_and_international_status"></a><h2>Politics and international status</h2><p>{{Politics of Kosovo}}
Kosovo's international status is anomalous in that although it is a Serbian province within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, administration is presently conducted by the <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> with little or no involvement on the part of the Serbia  government (under Security Council resolution 1244 of <a href='10 June'>10 June</a> <a href='1999'>1999</a>; see <a href='http://www.un.org/Docs/scres/1999/sc99.htm Security Council Resolutions 1999'>1</a>).  The government of the province is the responsibility of the <a href='United Nations Mission in Kosovo'>United Nations Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK). Under the terms of the <a href='Kumanovo agreement'>Kumanovo agreement</a> and subsequent UN <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a> <a href='Resolution 1244'>Resolution 1244</a>, which ended the <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a>, security is provided by the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which is led by <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> and is answerable to UNMIK.</p>
<p>UNMIK has so far established a provisional assembly, provisional government and the office of provisional president, which are legislative and executive bodies under UNMIK's control. Control of security, justice and external affairs are still under full UNMIK control. Elections for the <a href='Assembly of Kosovo'>Assembly of Kosovo</a> were held in November <a href='2001'>2001</a> and again in <a href='2004'>2004</a>. <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> was elected as president in March <a href='2002'>2002</a>. The seat of the assembly, government and president is in <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a>/<a href='Pristina'>Pristina</a>. So far, the parliament has enacted and UNMIK approved a constitutional framework, customs code, and two criminal codes.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Framework enacted by the Kosovo assembly (with UN Security Council approval) has adopted a policy of <a href='affirmative action'>affirmative action</a> in the assembly to ensure that the province's minorities are properly represented. Out of 120 seats, 10 are reserved for Serbs and another 10 for non-Albanian minorities, while the remaining 100 seats are elected through direct voting. UNIK does not take account, though, of Serbs and other non-Albanians who have left Kosovo as a result of interethnic tension, many of whom are unable to reclaim lost property or safely to attend elections. The process of 'returns' of these displaced persons has yet to begin in earnest, as a result of insufficient funding and a perceived inability of the UN to control violence against minority groups, as well as a concern on the part of Kosovo Albanians that an increased proportion of Serbs will undermine the chances for an independent Kosovo.</p>
<p>Kosovo is still recognised internationally as a part of Serbia. Its final status has not yet been resolved, though talks on the subject are planned for 2006, and considerable difficulties lie ahead in reconciling the irreconcilable Kosovo Albanian, Kosovo Serb and Belgrade positions. The Kosovo Albanians reject Serbian sovereignty and demand secession from the country. On the other side, Serbia is opposed to yielding any of its territory and domestic opinion, supported by the existence of a centuries old written, material and architectural history, continues to see the province as the heartland of Serbian culture.</p>
<p>The international community is reluctant to see Kosovo become independent, as its independence without Belgrade's consent would violate <a href='international law'>international law</a> (the principles of <a href='territorial integrity'>territorial integrity</a> and <a href='noninterference in internal affairs'>noninterference in internal affairs</a>). It could also potentially provide a precedent for the parallel Serb demands of secession for the <a href='Republika Srpska'>Republika Srpska</a> from <a href='Bosnia and Herzegovina'>Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, re-igniting tension in that country. The <a href='NATO'>NATO</a> countries insisted on the republican borders as the only acceptable solution during the wars in <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a> and <a href='Bosnia-Herzegovina'>Bosnia-Herzegovina</a> in the 1990s, but this does not rule out that they might revisit this in the case of Kosovo vis-Ã -vis Serbia and Montenegro. Questions have also been raised about whether an independent Kosovo would be politically or economically viable, given its small size, the state of its economy and fears that criminal and smuggling networks have strong positions there.</p>
<p>UNMIK is issuing travel documents which serve instead of <a href='passport'>passports</a> in countries which recognise them, and issues identity cards and car plates, which again are valid only in certain countries. UNMIK has created a police force (the <a href='Kosovo Police Service'>Kosovo Police Service</a>) with employees from all ethnic communities (Albanian, Serbian, Roma, Bosniac, etc) and manages the province's railways and airline (<a href='Kosova Airlines'>Kosova Airlines</a>). The airspace of the province is controlled by KFOR.</p>
<p>On <a href='January 21'>January 21</a>, <a href='2006'>2006</a>, the President of Kosovo, Dr.<a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a>, died aged 61.</p>
<a name="Economy"></a><h2>Economy</h2><p><a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a> declared the <a href='euro'>euro</a> to be official currency of the province in <a href='2001'>2001</a> in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the <a href='Deutschmark'>Deutschmark</a>, which had become <em>de facto</em> currency even before the 1999 war. However, the <a href='Serbian dinar'>Serbian dinar</a> remains an official currency, though used principally in the <a href='Kosovo Serb enclaves'>Kosovo Serb enclaves</a>; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro, Kosovo's administration uses euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the <a href='United States dollar'>United States dollar</a> and <a href='Swiss franc'>Swiss franc</a> are the most widespread.</p>
<a name="Demographics"></a><h2>Demographics</h2><p>Ethnic Albanians now comprise almost 88.5% of the population of the province, a percentage which has increased over time as a result of a high birth rate, illegal Albanian immigration and non-Albanian emigration. Though mass emigration of Kosovo Albanians during the Kosovo crisis was allegedly a deciding factor in NATO intervention, the United Nations has succeeded in resettling and rehousing all displaced Kosovo Albanians. In the aftermath of the conflict several hundred thousand non-Albanians, particularly <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a>, <a href='Janjevci|Janjevs'>Janjevci|Janjevs</a>, and <a href='Roma people|Roma'>Roma people|Roma</a>, were forcibly expelled by the Albanian majority or fled the province to escape continued ethnic violence. The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall in since the arrival of NATO and the UN as a result of targeted violence, intimidation and economic hardship. Many still live in communal camps in <a href='Serbia proper'>Serbia proper</a>, cared for by international relief agencies and the Serbian governement.</p>
<p>According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo<a href='http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf'>2</a>, Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1,8 and 2,0 million in the following ethnic proportions:</p>
<ul>
<li>88% <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> (between 1,584,000 and 1,733,600)</li>
<li> 
7% <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> (between 126,000 and 140,000)</li>
<li>	
3% <a href='Muslims by nationality|Muslims'>Muslims by nationality|Muslims</a> and <a href='Bosniaks'>Bosniaks</a> (54 to 60 thousand)</li>
<li> 
2% <a href='Roma people|Roma'>Roma people|Roma</a> (36 to 40 thousand) <a href='Roma in Mitrovica Camps'>Roma in Mitrovica Camps</a></li>
<li>1% <a href='Dinosaurs'>Dinosaurs</a> (18 to 20 thousand)</li>
</ul>
<p>Intercommunal violence has further reduced the number of non-Albanians in Kosovo since this survey, and many of those who do remain now live in heavily guarded enclaves.</p>
