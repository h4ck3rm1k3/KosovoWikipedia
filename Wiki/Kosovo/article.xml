'''Kosovo''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosovë''/''Kosova'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Косово и Метохија''/''Kosovo i Metohija'') is one of two provinces in [[Serbia]] (the other is [[Vojvodina]], in northern Serbia). It is located in the south of the country bordering [[Albania]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]]. The mountainous province's capital and largest city is [[Priština]]. Kosovo has a population of around two million people, predominately ethnic [[Albanians]], with smaller populations of [[Serbs]] and other ethnic groups.  

The province is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and before then, the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) government and Kosovo's Albanian population. Although ''[[de jure]]'' a part of Serbia, it has been administered by the [[United Nations]] since the end of the [[Kosovo War]] in [[1999]]. Kosovo is governed by the [[UNMIK|UN Interim Administrative Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) and the locally elected [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]], with security maintained by the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) and [[Kosovo Police Service]]. Negotiations began in [[2006]] to determine the final status of Kosovo.

[[image:UTkosovo rel small 92.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Physical map of Kosovo]]
With an area of [[1 E10 m²|10,912]] [[square kilometre]]s (4,213 [[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) and a population of over two million on the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Central Serbia]] to the North and East, [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] to the south and [[Albania]] to the southwest. The largest cities are [[Priština]] (''Prishtinë'', in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]) the capital, with an estimated 500,000 citizens, and [[Prizren]] in the southwest with 120,000 citizens; five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000. The climate in Kosovo is continental with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. 

There are two main plains in Kosovo, located in the western part of the land (''Rrafshi i Dukagjinit'', in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], the naming [[Metohija]] is used mostly by [[Serbian people|Serbs]]) and the ''plain of Kosovo'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Rrafshi i Kosovës, [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Kosovska Dolina'').  

Kosovo is mainly mountainous and hilly. [[Sar Mountain]] (in Albanian ''Mali i Sharrit'') is located in the south and south-east, bordering [[Macedonia]]. It is one of the most popular tourist and skiing resorts, with [[Brezovica]] and Prevalac (in Albanian Prevallë) as the main tourist centres. Kosovo's mountainous area, including the highest peak Deravica (in Albanian ''Gjeravica'') (2656 m above sea level), is located in the south-west, bordering [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]]. The mountains are known by Albanians as ''Bjeshkët e Nemuna'' (translated in English ''Cursed mountains'') and sometimes as the ''Albanian Alps''. Serbs call the mountain range ''Prokletije''. The Kopaonik mountain is located in the north, bordering [[Serbia proper]]. The central region of [[Drenica]], Carraleva (in Serbian Crnoljevo) and the eastern part of Kosovo, named ''Gallap'' (Serbian: Golak), are mainly hilly areas. There are several rivers and lakes in Kosovo. The main rivers are Drin River (in Albanian: Drini i Bardhë, in Serbian: Beli Drin), into which several other waterways flow, including the Erenik, and runs towards the [[Adriatic Sea]],  Sitnica, Morava in Gollak area and Ibar (Albanian Ibër) in the north. The main lakes are ''Badovc'' in north-east and ''Gazivoda'' in north-western part.

== History ==
{{History of Kosovo}}
{{main|History of Kosovo}}
:''See also: [[Demographic history of Kosovo]]''
=== Ancient ===
The region of Kosovo is believed to have been inhabited by [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribes]] since the [[Bronze Age]]. In ancient times, the area was known as [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The south of Kosovo was ruled by [[Macedon|Macedonia]] since [[Alexander the Great]]'s reign in the 4th century BC. The local [[Dardani]] were of [[Illyrian]] or [[Thracian]] stock. Illyrians resisted rule by the [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for centuries but after the long periods of conflict between Illyrian tribes and invading imperial powers, the region was eventually occupied by the [[Roman Empire]] under Emperor [[Augustus]] in 28 BC and became part of the Roman province of [[Moesia]]. After [[85|AD 85]] it was part of [[Moesia]] Superior. Emperor [[Diocletian]] later c. [[284]] made Dardania into separate province with its capital at Naissus ([[Niš]]). When the Roman Empire split in [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] [[395]], the area of Kosovo came under the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Many inhabitants of [[Dardania]] became leaders in Rome and [[Constantinopolis]], including [[Justinian the Great]].

=== Medieval ===
==== Great Migrations and Interregnums ====
[[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] came to the territories that now form modern Kosovo in the [[6th century|6th]]-[[7th century|7th centuries]], with the largest influx of migrants in the 630s. The Slavs were [[Christianization|Christianized]] in several waves between the [[7th century|7th]] and [[9th century]], with the last wave taking place between [[867]] and [[874]]. The northwestern part of Kosovo, [[Hvosno]], became a part of the Byzantine [[Serb]] vassal state the [[Principality of Rascia]], with [[Desnik|Dostinik]] as the principality's capital.

In the late 800s, the whole of Kosovo was seized by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Czardom of the Bulgarians]]. Although [[Serbia]] restored control over [[Metohija]] throughout the 10th century, the rest of Kosovo was returned to the Byzantine Empire after the Bulgarian Empire crumbled in the late 900s. In a [[Slavic]] rebellion led [[Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria]], the whole of Kosovo came under the control of the renewed [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Czardom]] from the late 10th century, until the Byzantine restoration of 1018. In 1040-1041, Slavs staged a rebellion against the Eastern Roman Empire that temporarily encompassed Kosovo. After the rebellion was crushed, the Byzantines restored control. 

Throughout the following decades, numerous foreign peoples invading the Byzantine Empire stormed Kosovo, among them the [[Cumans]]. 

In 1072, local Slavs under George Voiteh pushed a final attempt to restore Imperial Bulgarian power and invited the last heir of the [[House of Comitopuli]] - [[Duklja]]'s prince [[Constantine Bodin (Peter III)|Konstantin Bodin]] of the [[House of Vojislavljevic]], son of the [[List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King]] [[Mihailo Voislav]] - to assume power. The Serbs decided to conquer the entire Byzantine region of Bulgaria. King Mihailo dispatched his son with 300 elite Serb fighters led by Duke Petrilo. Constantine Bodin was crowned in [[Prizren]] as ''Petar III'' [[List of rulers of Bulgaria|Czar of the Bulgarians]] by Goerge Voiteh and the Slavic Boyars. The Empire swept across Byzantine territories in months, until the significant losses on the south had forced Czar Petar to withdraw. In 1073, the Byzantine forces chased Constantine Bodin, defeated his army at [[Pauni]] and imprisoned him.

==== Serbian takeover ====
The full Serbian takeover was carried out under a branch of the [[House of Vojislavljević|House of Voislav]] [[Grand Prince|Grand Princes]] of [[Rascia]]. In [[1093]], Prince Vukan advanced on [[Lipljan]], burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The Byzantine Emperor himself came to [[Zvečan]] for negotiations. Zvečan served as the Byzantine line-of-defence against constant invasions from the neighboring Serbs. A peace agreement was made, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. Vukan's armies stormed Kosovo. In [[1094]], [[Alexius I Comnenus|Byzantine Emperor Alexius]] attempted to renew peace negotiations in Ulpiana. A new peace agreement was concluded and Vukan handed over hostages to the Emperor, including his two nephews Uroš and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the conflict in [[1106]], once again defeating John Comnenus' army. However, his death halted the total Serb conquest of Kosovo.

In [[1166]], a Serbian nobleman from [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of the [[Nemanjić|House of Nemanja]] ascended to the Rascian Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo, in an uprising against the Byzantine Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]]. He defeated the previous Grand Prince of Rascia Tihomir's army at Pantino, near Pauni. Tihomir, who was Stefan's brother, was drowned in the [[Sitnica]] river. Stefan was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests. He pledged to the Emperor that he would not renew hostilies, but in [[1183]], Stefan Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the [[Hungarians]] after the death of [[Manuel I Comnenus]] in [[1180]], marking the end of Byzantine domination of Kosovo.

Nemanja's son, [[Stefan Prvovenčani|Stefan II]], recorded that the border of the Serbian realm reached the river of Lab. Grand Prince Stephen II completed the inclusion of the Kosovo territories under Serb rule in 1208, by which time he had conquered Prizren and Lipljan, and moved the border of territory under his control to the Šar mountain.

==== Kingdom of the Serbs ====
In [[1217]], the [[History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom]] achieved recognition. In [[1219]], an autocephalous [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was created, with [[Hvosno]], Prizren and Lipljan being the Orthodox Christian [[Episcopates]] on Kosovo. By the end of the [[13th century]], the centre of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church]] was moved to [[Peć]] from [[Žiča]].

In the 13th century, Kosovo becomes the heart of the Serbian political and religious life, with the Šar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was in Pauni. On an island was [[Svrčin]], and on the coast [[Štimlji]], and in the mountains was the Castle of [[Nerodimlje]]. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating, and as the rulers' living quarters. After 1291, the Tartars broke all the way to Peć. [[List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King]] [[Stefan Milutin]] managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the [[Mother of Christ]] of Ljeviška in Prizren around 1307, which became the seat of the Prizren Episcopric, and the magnificent [[Gračanica]] in 1335, the seat of the Lipljan Episcopric. In 1331, Juvenille King Dušan attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in Nerodimlje. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of [[Petrič]], but Dušan captured him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palailogos and their children in Zvečan, where the dethroned King died on [[11 November]] [[1331]].

In 1327 and 1328, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani started forming the vast Dečani domain, although, Serbian King Dušan would finish it in 1335. Stefan of Dechani issued the Dechani Charter in 1330, listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne.

==== Serbian Empire and Despotate ====
[[Monarch|King]] [[Stefan Dušan]] founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archaengel near Prizren in [[1342]]-[[1352]]. The Kingdom was transformed into an [[Serbian Empire|Empire]] in 1345 and officially in 1346. Stefan Dušan received [[John VI Cantacuzenus]] in [[1342]] in his Castle in [[Pauni]] to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In [[1346]], the Serbian [[Archbishopric|Archepiscopric]] at Peć was upgraded into a [[Patriarchate]], but it was not recognized before [[1370]]. 

After the Empire fell into disarray prior to Dušan's death in [[1355]], feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar [[Stefan Uroš V]]. Kosovo became a domain of the [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević|House of Mrnjavčević]], but Prince Voislav Voinović expanded his demesne further into Kosovo. The armies of King [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević]] from [[Priština]] and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in [[1369]], putting a halt to his advances. After the [[Battle of Marica]] on [[26 September]] [[1371]], in which the Mrnjavčević brothers lost their lives, [[House of Balšić|Đurađ I Balšić]] of [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]] took Prizren and Peć in [[1372]]. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the [[Prince Lazar|House of Lazarević]].

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] invaded and met the Christian coalition under [[Prince Lazar]] on [[28 June]] [[1389]], near [[Priština]], at Gazi Mestan. The Serbian Army was assisted by various allies. The epic [[Battle of Kosovo]] followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the Ottomans had 140,000. Through the cunning of [[Miloš Obilić]], [[Sultan]] [[Murad I|Murad]] was murdered and the new Sultan [[Beyazid]] had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both [[Prince Lazar]] and [[Miloš Obilić]] were canonised by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] for their efforts in the battle. The local House of [[Vuk Branković|Branković]] came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under [[Vuk Branković]], with the temporary fall of the [[History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate]] in [[1439]]. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by the Albanian ruler Gjergj Kastrioti [[Skanderbeg]] on one side, and Ottoman troops supported by the [[House of Branković|Branković]]s in [[1448]]. Skanderbeg's troops that were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the Branković's troops, who was more or less a Turkish [[Vassal]]. Hungarian King [[John Hunyadi]] lost the battle after a 2-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the Ottoman Empire, until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in 1459. 

In 1455, new castles rose to prominence in [[Prishtina]] and [[Vučitrn]], centres of the Ottoman vassalaged House of Branković.

=== Ottoman rule ===
{{main|Viyalet of Kosovo}}
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islamisation]] with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the [[Viyalet of Kosovo]] as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. This brought a great shift, as the Orthodox Serb population began to lose its majority when masses of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Albanians]] ([[Muslims]]) moved to Kosovo. During the Islamisation, many Churches and Holy Orthodox Christian places were razed to the ground or turned in to Mosques. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near Prizren was torn down at the end of the 16th century and the material used to build the Mosque of Sinan-pasha, an Islamized Serb, in Prizren. Although the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was officially abolished in 1532, an Islamized Serb from Bosnia, Vizier [[Mehmed-pasha Sokolović]] influenced the restoration of the [[Patriarchate of Peć]] in 1557. Special privileges were provided, which helped the survival of Serbs and other Christians in Kosovo. 

Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of [[1683]] - [[1699]] with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a [[Catholic Archibishop]] [[Pjetër Bogdani]]. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion. In [[1690]], the [[Serbian Patriarch of Peć]] [[Arsenije III]], who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the Ottomans. The people that followed him were mostly [[Serbs]] – 20,000 Serbs abandoned [[Prizren]] alone - but they were likely followed by other ethnic groups. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the [[18th century]]. It is also noted that some [[Serbs]] adopted [[Islam]], while some even gradually fused with other groups, predominantly Albanianians, adopting their culture and even language. By the end of the 19th century, [[Albanians]] replaced the Serbs as the dominating nation of Kosovo.

In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Patriarchate of Peć]] and the position of [[Christians]] in Kosovo was greatly reduced. All previous privileges were lost, and the Christian population had to suffer the full weight of the Empire's extensive and losing wars, even having blame forced upon them for the losses.

=== Modern ===
In 1871, a massive Serbian meeting was held in Prizren. The possible retaking and reintegration of Kosovo and the rest of &quot;Old Serbia&quot; was discussed at the meeting, as the [[History of Serbia|Principality of Serbia]] itself had already made plans for expansions towards Ottoman territory, much easier than elsewhere. 

Albanian refugees from the territories conquered in the [[1876]]-[[1877]] Serbo-Turkish war and the [[1877]]-[[1878]] Russo-Turkish are now known as '[[muhajir (Albania)|muhaxher]]' (which means 'refugee', from [[Arabic]] [[muhajir]]) and are the ancestors of many who are still known by their same surnames, ''Muhaxheri''. It is also estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 Serbs were cleansed out of the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] between [[1876]] and [[1912]], especially during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War]] in [[1897]]. 

In 1878, a Peace Accord was drawn that gave the cities of [[Prishtina]] and [[Mitrovica]] under civil Serbian control, outside the Ottoman authorities, while the rest of Kosovo would be under Ottoman control. As a responce, the Albanians formed the nationalistic &amp; conservative [[League of Prizren]] in [[Prizren]] later the same year. Over 300 Albanian leaders from Kosovo and western Macedonia gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning protection of Albanian populated regions from division among neighbouring countries. The League was supported by the Ottoman Sultan because of its Pan-Islamic ideology and political aspirations of a [[Greater Albania|unified Albanian people]] under the Ottoman umbrella. The movement gradually became anti-Christian and spread great anxiety among Christian Albanians and especially among Christian Serbs. As a result, more and more Serbs left Kosovo northwards. Serbia complained to the World Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. The World Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting the Albanian forces. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl Frashëri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. The subsequent Treaty of San Stefano in 1898 restored most Albanian lands to Ottoman control, but the Serbian forces had to retreat from Kosovo along with some Serbs that were expelled as well{{citation needed}}. 

In 1908, the Sultan brought a new democratic decrete that was valid only for Turkish-speakers. As the vast majority of Kosovo spoke Albanian or Serbian, the Kosovar population was very unhappy. The Young Turk movement supported a centralist rule and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by Kosovars, and particularely the Albanians. In 1910, an [[Albanian]] uprising spread from [[Prishtina]] and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in June of 1911. The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However at that time Serbs have consisted about ''40%'' of the whole Vilayt of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to occupy Kosovo.

In [[1912]] during the [[Balkan Wars]], most of Kosovo was taken by the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]], while the region of [[Metohija]] ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Dukagjini Valley'') was taken by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. An exodus of the local Albanian population occurred. This is best described by [[Leon Trotsky]], who was the reporter for the 'Pravda' newspaper at the time. The Serbian authorities planned a recolonization of Kosovo&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.elsie.de/pdf/B2002GatheringClouds.pdf Elsie, R. (ed.) (2002): ''Gathering Clouds. The roots of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Early twentieth-century documents''. Dukagjini Balkan Books, Peja (Kosovo, Serbia). ISBN 9951-05-016-6&lt;/ref&gt;. Numerous colonist Serb families moved-in to Kosovo, equalizing the demographic balance between Albanians and Serbs. Many Albanians fled into the mountains and numerious Albanian and Turkish houses were raized. The reconquest of Kosovo was noted as a vengance for the 1389 [[Battle of Kossovo]]. At the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1912 presided over by Sir Edward Grey, the British Foreign Secretary, the Kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro were acknowledged sovereignty over Kosovo. 

&lt;!-- removed unlicensed image [[Image:1Serbian_army_retreat_WW1.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian army retreat]] --&gt;
In the winter of [[1915]]-[[1916]] during [[World War I]] Kosovo saw a large exodus of Serbian army which became known as the ''Great Serbian Retreat''. Defeated and worn out in battles against Austro-Hungarians, they had no other choice than to retreat, as Kosovo was occupied by [[Third Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] and [[Austro-Hungarians]]. The Albanians joined and supported the [[Central Powers]]. As opposed to Serbian schools, numerious Albanian schools were opened during the occupation. Allied ships were awaiting for Serbian people and soldiers at the banks of the Adriatic sea and the path leading them there went across Kosovo and Albania. Tens of thousands of soldiers have died of starvation, extreme weather and Albanian reprisals as they were approaching the [[Allies]] in [[Corfu]] and [[Thessaloniki]], amassing a total of 100,000 dead retreaters.{{citation needed}} Transported away from the front lines, Serbian army managed to heal many wounded and ill soldiers and get some rest. Refreshed and regrouped, it decided to return to the battlefield. In 1918 the Serbian Army pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. During their liberation of Kosovo, the Serbian Army committed atrocities against the population in revenge. Serbian Kosovo was unified with Montengrin as Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia. After the World War I ended, the Monarchy was then transformed into the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] ''(&quot;Mbretëria Serbe,Kroate,Sllovene&quot; in Albanian, &quot; &quot;Kraljevina Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca&quot; in Serbo-Croatian)'' on '''1st december 1918''', gathering territories gained in victory. 

==== Kingdom of Yugoslavia and WWII ====
The 1918-1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a raise of the Serbian population in the region and a decline in the non-Serbian. In the Kingdom Kosovo was split onto four counties - three being a part of the entity of Serbia: Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one of Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since [[26 April]] [[1922]] split Kosovo among three Areas of the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Rascia]] and [[Zeta]]. In 1921 the Albanian elite lodged an official protest of the government to the League of Nations, claiming that 12,000 Albanians had been killed and over 22,000 imprisoned since 1918 and seeking a [[Greater Albania|unification of Albanian-populated lands]]. The League of Nations did not respond, as the appeal was found unfounded. As a result, an armed ''Kachak'' resistance movement was formed whose main goal was to unite Albanian-populated areas of the Kingdom to Albania. 

In 1929 the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] which the ''[[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]]'' nationality unifying all Kosovan [[Slavs]]. The territories of Kosovo were split among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. The Kingdom lasted until the [[World War II]] [[Axis_powers|Axis]] invastion of 1941. 

The greatest part of Kosovo became a part of [[Italy|Italian]]-controlled [[Greater Albania|Fascist Albania]], and smaller bits by the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-[[Fascist]] [[Greater Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany|German]]-occupied [[Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]]. Since the Albanian Fascist political leadership had decided in the [[Conference of Bujan]] that Kosovo would remain a part of Albania they started an ethnic cleansing campaign of the non-Albanian population in the Kosovo. The infamous [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|SS Division Skanderbeg]] committed crimes. {{citation needed}}. Tens of thousands of Serbs lost their lives and around 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the war. Hundreds of thousands more would leave in the following decades, following the shift of power in Kosovo. 

Prior to the surrender of [[History of Italy|Fascist Italy]] in [[1943]], the German forces took over direct control of the region. After numerous uprisings of [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Chetniks]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Partisans]], the latter being lead by [[Fadil Hoxha]], Kosovo was liberated after [[1944]] with the help of the Albanian partisans of the [[Comintern]], and became a province of [[Serbia]] within the [[Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].

==== Kosovo in the Second Yugoslavia ====
The Province of Kosovo was formed in 1945 as an autonomous region to protect its regional [[Albanians|Albanian]] majority within the [[History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia]] as a member of the [[SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, [[Josip Broz Tito]], but with no factual autonomy. After Yugoslavia's name change to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Serbia's to the [[History of Serbia|Socialist Republic of Serbia]] in [[1953]], Kosovo gained inner autonomy in the 1960s. In the [[1974]] constitution, the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles — President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a ''de facto'' Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Region within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] were defined as official languages on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Serbs and Albanians. In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. The ethnic balance of Kosovo witnessed unproportional increase as the number of [[Albanians]] tripled gradually rising from almost ''65%'' to over ''80%'', but the number of [[Serbs]] barely increased and dropped in the full share of the total population from some ''25%'' down to ''10%''.

Beginning in March [[1981]], Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia.

In [[1986]], the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) was working on a document which later would be known as the [[SANU Memorandum]], a warning to the Serbian President and Assembly of the existing crisis and where it would lead. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU criticised the state of Yugoslavia and made remarks that the only member state contributing at the time to the development of Kosovo and Macedonia (by then, the poorest territories of the Federation) was Serbia. According to SANU, Yugoslavia was suffering of ethnic strives and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation&lt;ref&gt;SANU (1986): [http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/memorandum/contents.html Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Memorandum]. GIP Kultura. Belgrade.&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, some think that [[Slobodan Milošević]] used the discontent reflected in the SANU memorandum for his own political goals, during his rise to power in [[Serbia]] at the time&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/articles/ViewPopUpArticle.jsp?id=2&amp;articleId=3361 Julie A Mertus: &quot;Slobodan Milosevic: Myth and Responsibility&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

By the end of the 1980s, calls for increased federal control in the crisis-torn autonomous province were getting louder. [[Slobodan Milošević]] pushed for constitutional change amounting to suspension of autonomy for both Kosovo and [[Vojvodina]] &lt;ref name=&quot;reuters19880730&quot;&gt;Reuters 1988-07-30, &quot;Yugoslav Leaders Call for Control in Kosovo, Protests Loom&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Kosovo War ====
{{main|Kosovo War}}
One of the events that contributed to Milošević's rise of power was the ''Gazimestan Speech'', delivered in front of 100,000 Serb citizens at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]], held at [[Gazimestan]] on 28 June, 1989. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkanpeace.org/cib/kam/kams/kams19.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, Milošević criticised the &quot;dramatical national divisions&quot; and called Yugoslavia &quot;a multinational community [which] can survive only under the conditions of full equality for all nations that live in it.&quot; 

Soon afterwards, as approved by the Assembly in 1990, the autonomy of Kosovo was reduced. After [[Slovenia]]'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, Milošević used the seat to attain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents. 

Many Albanians organized a peaceful separatist movement. State institutions and elections were boycotted and separate Albanian schools and political institutions were established. On [[July 2]], [[1990]] an unconstitutional Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, this was not recognized by the Government or any foreign states. In September of that year, the unofficial parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of [[Kaçanik]], adopted the ''Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo''. Two years later, in 1992, the parliament organized an unofficial referendum which was observed by international organisations {{citation needed}} but was not recognized internationally. With an ''80%'' turnout, ''98%'' voted for Kosovo to be independent.

With the events in [[Bosnia]] and [[Croatia]] coming to an end, the Serb government started relocating Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia all over Serbia, including in Kosovo. In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make room for the refugees{{citation needed}}.
[[Image:Kosovo_pisg_logo.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The Coat of Arms of the [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]]]]
After the [[Dayton]] Agreement in 1995, some Albanians organized into the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), employing guerilla-style tactics against Serbian police forces and civilians. Violence escalated in a series of KLA attacks and Serbian reprisals into the year 1999, with increasing numbers of civilian victims. In 1998 western interest increased and the Serbian authorities was forced to sign a unilateral cease-fire and partial retreat. Under an agreement led by [[Richard Holbrooke]], [[OSCE]] observers moved into Kosovo to monitor the ceasefire, while Yugoslav military forces partly pulled out of Kosovo. However, the ceasefire was systematically broken shortly thereafter by KLA forces, which again provoked harsh counterattacks by the Serbs. On 16 January 1999, the bodies of 45 Albanian civilians were found in the town of [[Racak]]. The victims had most likely been executed by Serb forces [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1812847.stm][http://www.hrw.org/press/1999/jan/yugo0129.htm]. The so-called Racak Massacre was instrumental in increasing the pressure on Serbia in the following conference at [[Rambouillet]]. After more than a month of negotations Yugoslavia refused to sign the prepared agreement, primarily, it has beeen argued, because of a clause giving NATO forces access rights to not only Kosovo but to all of Yugoslavia (which the Yugoslav side saw as tantamount to military occupation).

This triggered a 78-day [[NATO]] campaign in [[1999]]. At first limited to military targets in Kosovo proper, the bombing campaign was soon extended to cover targets all over Yugoslavia, including bridges, power stations, factories, broadcasting stations, post offices, and various government buildings. 

During the conflict, several thousand were killed, the numbers and the ethnic distribution of the casualties are uncertain and highly disputed. An estimated 10,000-12,000 ethnic Albanians and 3,000 Serbs are believed to have been killed during the conflict, including military personnel and civilians, primarily as a result of the ground war in Kosovo between the KLA and the Yugoslav military, Serbian police and Serbian paramilitary forces. Some 3000 people are still missing,of which 2,500 are Albanian,400 Serbs and 100 Roma[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm]. According to OSCE numbers and Kosovar Albanian sources on population size and distribution, an estimated ''45.7%'' of the Albanian population and ''59.5%'' of the Serb population had fled Kosovo during the bombings (i.e. from 23 March to 9 June 1999). 

With the arrival of NATO, a large number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 100,000 by the UNHCR. Around 120,000 remain in Kosovo. Many Serbs fear to return to their homes since they perceive not to be safe for them, even with [[UNMIK]] protection, notably the [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004]], when 900 Serbian houses were burned and other property destroyed{{citation needed}} while the Serbian populace was closed into enclaves and had to concentrate to the north of Kosovo until today, causing a wave of 3,500 Serbian refugees.

Among the numerous [[UNESCO]] World Heritage sites destroyed by the Albanian para-military{{citation needed}} forces is King [[Stefan Milutin]]'s grave, [[Our Lady of Ljeviš Orthodox Cathedral]] from the 12th century in [[Prizren]]. In total, more than 30 Orthodox Serb Churches and Monasteries were destroyed during the March unrest in Kosovo. Many of the Churches and Monasteries were dating back to the 12th, 13th and 14th century. At the end of the two-day riots, 19 people were dead, 11 Albanians and 8 Serbs.

During the Kosovo War, Serbs also engaged in a deliberate campaign of cultural destruction and rampage. According to a report compiled by the Kosovo Cultural Heritage Project, Serbian forces tried to wipe out all Albanian culture and traditions. Of the 500 mosques that were in use prior to the war, 200 of them were completely destroyed or desecrated. The report concludes that most mosques were deliberately set on fire with no sign of fighting around the area. Among numerous other things, the following important objects were destroyed because they represented Albanian as well as Muslim and Catholic cultures:

Sinan Pasha Mosque in Prizren, the Prizren League Museum, the Hadum Mosque complex in Gjakova (Serbian: Djakovica); the historic bazaars in Gjakova and Pec (Albanian: Peja); the Roman Catholic church of [St. Anthony in Gjakova]; and two old Ottoman bridges, Ura e Terzive (Terzijski most) and Ura e Tabakeve (Tabacki most), near Gjakova.[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/kosovo/herscherriedlmayer.htm]


== Politics ==
&lt;!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series--&gt;
{{morepolitics|country=Kosovo}}

The talks on the future status of Kosovo between the government of Serbia, which wants the territory to remain part of Serbia albeit with a high degree of autonomy, and the provisional government of Kosovo, which wants independence for the province, have started in [[Vienna]], on February 20, [[2006]]. According to the UN Envoy to the status talks the status will be resolved by the end of year [[2006]].

== Economy ==

Kosovo is one of the poorest economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at 964 [[Euro]] (2004).[http://ec.europa.eu/comm/enlargement/serbia_montenegro/kosovo_economical_profile.htm] Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia &lt;ref name=&quot;csm19811215&quot;&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, over the course of the 1990s, poor economic policies, international sanctions, weak access to external trade and finance, and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html]

Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001 [[GDP]] growth was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high [[external deficit]]s. In 2004, the deficit of the [[balance of goods and services]] was close to 70 percent of [[GDP]]. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of [[GDP]], and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of [[GDP]].[http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf] 

Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.[http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386] [http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf] 

UNMIK introduced ''de-facto'' an external trade regime and customs administration on September 3, 1999 when it set customs border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported in Kosovo face a flat 10% customs duty fee.[http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html] These taxes are collected from all Tax Collection Points installed at the borders of Kosovo, including those between Kosovo and  Serbia.[http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf]. UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed Free Trade Agreements with [[Bosnia and Hercegovina]][http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf], [[Albania]][http://www.kosovo-eicc.org/oek/index.php?page_id=64] and [[Macedonia]][http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html]. 

The [[Euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and used by UNMIK and the government bodies[http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php]. The Serbian [[Dinar]] is used in the Serbian populated parts.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo[http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf], Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1,8 and 2,0 million in the following ethnic proportions:
* ''88%'' [[Albanians]] (between 1,584,000 and 1,733,600) 
* ''7%'' [[Serbs]] (between 126,000 and 140,000)	
* ''1.9%'' [[Bosniaks]] (between 34,200 and 38,000) 
* ''1.7%'' [[Roma people|Roma]] (between 30,600 and 34,000) (see also [[Roma in Mitrovica Camps]])
* ''1%'' [[Turkish people|Turks]] (between 18,000 and 20,000)

However, the figures are highly disputable. Some estimates are that there is an Albanian majority well above 90 percent. The population census is set to take place in the near future. Others give much higher figures for Roma and Turks [http://www.siri-us.com/backgrounders/Archives_Kosovo/Kosovo-Milosevic.html][http://www.salon.com/news/1999/03/31newsa.html][http://www.serbianunity.net/news/world_articles/Dragnich1098.html]. There was a small minority of [[Circassians]] in [[Kosovo Polje]](Fushë-Kosovë in Albanian) but they were repatriated to the [[Republic of Adygea]], in Southern [[Russia]], following the start of the Kosovo War.[[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/143667.stm]].
