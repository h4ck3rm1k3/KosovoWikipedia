<p>{{Politics of Kosovo}}
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted UNMIK with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states (e.g., foreign affairs).  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.</p>
<p>According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (e.g., Bosniak, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.</p>
<p>  
The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora."  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.</p>
<p>  
In November 2001, the <a href='OSCE'>OSCE</a> supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  
After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in Ramush Haradinaj (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.</p>
<p>  
Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander [Agim Ceku].  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected Fatmir Sejdiu, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, is governments only Serbian minister and unlike other Serbians have chosen to not boycott the Kosovo institutions.</p>
<a name="Kosovo_Future_Status_Process"></a><h3>Kosovo Future Status Process</h3><p>{{Current event}}
:<em>See also: <a href='Constitutional status of Kosovo'>Constitutional status of Kosovo</a></em></p>
<p>A UN-led process was begun in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status.  This process will determine whether Kosovo should be independent or remain a part of the state of Serbia.  <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244'>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244</a> did not address Kosovo's status, but did envision an eventual political process to resolve this question.  In October 2005, a UN-commissioned report written by Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide assessed that Kosovo's undefined status was a factor for regional instability and should be settled soon.  As a result of this report, the UN <a href='Security Council'>Security Council</a> issued a Presidential Statement in November 2005 to endorse Eide's conclusions and authorize the launch of a status process.</p>
<p>  
Belgrade's position on Kosovo status is that Kosovo should be highly autonomous, but not independent.  The Belgrade negotiating platform, often characterized by Belgrade leaders as "more than autonomy, less than independence," envisions granting sweeping rights of self-governance for Kosovo, but would deny Kosovo a role in international affairs, defense or representation in Serbia's central governing institutions.  Pristina's position is that Kosovo should be independent, subject to robust institutional protections for Kosovo's minorities.  Belgrade frequently cites international law provisions about the integrity of sovereign states to justify its claim to Kosovo.  Pristina asserts that Kosovo's independence would be the result of the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the actions of Milosevic in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In November 2005, the <a href='Contact Group'>Contact Group</a> countries released a set of "Guiding Principles" for the resolution of Kosovo's status.  These principles notably included the requirement that there be no return to the situation prior to 1999 and that there be no change in Kosovo's borders (i.e., no partition of Kosovo) and no union of Kosovo with any neighboring state.  At a January 2006 meeting of foreign ministers, the Contact Group further declared that a settlement "needs, inter alia, to be acceptable to the people of Kosovo" and that "all possible efforts should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006."  Contact Group public statements have also emphasized the need to preserve Kosovo's multi-ethnic character.</p>
<p>The Kosovo future status process is led by UN Special Envoy <a href='Martti Ahtisaari'>Martti Ahtisaari</a>, former president of Finland; Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan is his deputy.  Ahtisaari's office -- the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) is located in <a href='Vienna'>Vienna</a>, Austria, and includes liaison staff from <a href='NATO'>NATO</a>, the <a href='European Union|EU'>European Union|EU</a> and the United States.  Ahtisaari is supported in his efforts by Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, the U.S. Representative to the Kosovo Status Talks.  Ahtisaari holds regular meetings with representatives of the <a href='Contact Group'>Contact Group</a>.</p>
<p>The initial status negotiations focused on technicalities important for Kosovo's long-term stability, particularly the rights and protection of Kosovo's minorities, particularly the Kosovo Serbs.  Ahtisaari brought the parties together for the first direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, which is an important measure to protect Kosovo Serb communities.  Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights of Kosovo's minorities.</p>
<p>  
On July 24, 2006, Ahtisaari brought the parties together in Vienna for the first high-level talks on the status outcome itself.  Serbian President <a href='Boris TadiÄ'>Boris TadiÄ</a> and Prime Minister <a href='Vojislav KoÅ¡tunica'>Vojislav KoÅ¡tunica</a> and Kosovo President <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>Fatmir Sejdiu</a> and Prime Minister <a href='Agim Ãeku'>Agim Ãeku</a> attended and presented their respective platforms for Kosovo's future status.  Ahtisaari later told the press that the meeting resulted in no breakthroughs, but that the parties generally listened respectfully to each other's position.</p>
<p>  
Ahtisaari briefed Contact Group foreign ministers on September 20, 2006, in New York City at a meeting chaired by U.S. Secretary of state <a href='Condoleezza Rice'>Condoleezza Rice</a>.  At that meeting, the Contact Group released a press statement that reaffirmed its commitment to achieve a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006.  The statement also endorsed Ahtisaari's plans to develop a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement, which he will take to the parties.</p>
<p>Most international observers believe these negotiations will lead to some form of independence &lt;ref&gt;"<a href='http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4489028 Kosovo's status - the wheels grind on'>1</a>", <em>The Economist</em>, October 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which Serbian leaders still reject.  The <a href='Contact Group'>Contact Group</a> has said in numerous public statements that regardless of status outcome a new international mission will be established in Kosovo to supervise the implementation status settlement and guarantee minority rights.  NATO has also announced its intention to maintain KFOR in Kosovo after the status settlement.</p>

Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of <a href='GDP'>GDP</a>. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of <a href='GDP'>GDP</a>, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of <a href='GDP'>GDP</a>.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
