'''Kosovo''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosovë'' or ''Kosova''; [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Косово и Метохија or ''Kosovo i Metohija'', also Космет or ''Kosmet'') is a province in southern [[Serbia]] which has been under [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|administration]] since [[1999]]. While Serbia's nominal [[sovereignty]] is recognised by the international community, in practice Serbian governance in the province is virtually non-existent (''see also [[Constitutional status of Kosovo]]''). The province is governed by the [[United Nations Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK) and the local [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government]], with security provided by the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR). 

Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The mountainous province's capital and largest city is [[Priština]]. Kosovo has a population of around two million people, predominately ethnic [[Albanians]], with smaller populations of [[Serbs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Bosniaks]] and other ethnic groups.

The province is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]) government and Kosovo's Albanian population. International negotiations began in [[2006]] to determine the final status of Kosovo.

With an area of [[1 E10 m²|10,912]] [[square kilometre]]s (4,213 [[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) and a population of over two million on the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Central Serbia]] to the North and East, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the south and [[Albania]] to the southwest. The province's present borders were established in [[1945]]. The republic of [[Serbia]] has one other autonomous province, [[Vojvodina]], located in the far north of the country.

The largest cities are [[Pristina]], the capital, with an estimated 600,000 citizens, and [[Prizren]] in the southwest with 120,000 citizens; five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000. The climate in Kosovo is continental with warm summers and cold and snowy winters. .

There are two main plains in Kosovo. The [[Metohija]]/Rrafshi i Dukagjinit basin is located in the western part of the province, and the Plain of Kosovo ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Rrafshi i Kosovës'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Kosovska Dolina'') occupies the central area.

Much of Kosovo's terrain is rugged. The [[Sar Mountain]] (Albanian: ''Mali i Sharrit'', Serbian: ''Šar Planina'') is located in the south and south-east, bordering [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It is one of the region's most popular tourist and skiing resorts, with [[Brezovica]] and Prevalac/Prevallë as the main tourist centres. Kosovo's mountainous area, including the highest peak Deravica/Gjeravica (2656 m above sea level), is located in the south-west, bordering [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]]. 

The mountain range dividing Kosovo from Albania is known in English as the [[Cursed Mountains]] or Albanian Alps (Albanian: ''Bjeshkët e Nemuna'', Serbian: ''Prokletije''). The Kopaonik mountain is located in the north, bordering [[Central Serbia]]. The central region of [[Drenica]], Carraleva/Crnoljevo and the eastern part of Kosovo, known as Gallap/Golak, are mainly hilly areas. 

There are several notable rivers and lakes in Kosovo. The main rivers are the [[Drin River]] (Albanian: ''Drini i Bardhë'', Serbian: ''Beli Drin''). Several other waterways flow into it, including the Erenik, and the river runs towards the [[Adriatic Sea]], Sitnica, Morava in the Gollak area and Ibar (Albanian Ibër) in the north. The main lakes are Badovc in the north-east and Gazivoda in the north-western part.

{{Politics of Kosovo}}
UN Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status.  This Resolution entrusted UNMIK with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance.  Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo.  NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment.

In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG).  Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states (e.g., foreign affairs).  Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service.

According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly.  The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (e.g., Bosniak, Roma, etc.).  The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo.  

The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to Milosevic's rule.  The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006.  The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj.  Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named &quot;Ora.&quot;  Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly.  

In November 2001, the [[OSCE]] supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly.  After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister.  

After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora.  This coalition agreement resulted in Ramush Haradinaj (AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President.  PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption.  

Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005.  He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK).  But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander [Agim Ceku].  Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs.  The Kosovo Assembly elected Fatmir Sejdiu, a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. Slaviša Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, is governments only Serbian minister and unlike other Serbians have chosen to not boycott the Kosovo institutions.

=== Kosovo Future Status Process ===
{{Current event}}
:''See also: [[Constitutional status of Kosovo]]''

A UN-led process was begun in late 2005 to determine Kosovo's future status.  This process will determine whether Kosovo should be independent or remain a part of the state of Serbia.  [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244]] did not address Kosovo's status, but did envision an eventual political process to resolve this question.  In October 2005, a UN-commissioned report written by Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide assessed that Kosovo's undefined status was a factor for regional instability and should be settled soon.  As a result of this report, the UN [[Security Council]] issued a Presidential Statement in November 2005 to endorse Eide's conclusions and authorize the launch of a status process.  

Belgrade's position on Kosovo status is that Kosovo should be highly autonomous, but not independent.  The Belgrade negotiating platform, often characterized by Belgrade leaders as &quot;more than autonomy, less than independence,&quot; envisions granting sweeping rights of self-governance for Kosovo, but would deny Kosovo a role in international affairs, defense or representation in Serbia's central governing institutions.  Pristina's position is that Kosovo should be independent, subject to robust institutional protections for Kosovo's minorities.  Belgrade frequently cites international law provisions about the integrity of sovereign states to justify its claim to Kosovo.  Pristina asserts that Kosovo's independence would be the result of the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the actions of Milosevic in the 1990s.

In November 2005, the [[Contact Group]] countries released a set of &quot;Guiding Principles&quot; for the resolution of Kosovo's status.  These principles notably included the requirement that there be no return to the situation prior to 1999 and that there be no change in Kosovo's borders (i.e., no partition of Kosovo) and no union of Kosovo with any neighboring state.  At a January 2006 meeting of foreign ministers, the Contact Group further declared that a settlement &quot;needs, inter alia, to be acceptable to the people of Kosovo&quot; and that &quot;all possible efforts should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006.&quot;  Contact Group public statements have also emphasized the need to preserve Kosovo's multi-ethnic character.

The Kosovo future status process is led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], former president of Finland; Austrian diplomat Albert Rohan is his deputy.  Ahtisaari's office -- the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Kosovo (UNOSEK) is located in [[Vienna]], Austria, and includes liaison staff from [[NATO]], the [[European Union|EU]] and the United States.  Ahtisaari is supported in his efforts by Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, the U.S. Representative to the Kosovo Status Talks.  Ahtisaari holds regular meetings with representatives of the [[Contact Group]].

The initial status negotiations focused on technicalities important for Kosovo's long-term stability, particularly the rights and protection of Kosovo's minorities, particularly the Kosovo Serbs.  Ahtisaari brought the parties together for the first direct dialogue in February 2006 to discuss decentralization of local government, which is an important measure to protect Kosovo Serb communities.  Subsequent meetings addressed economic issues, property rights, protection of Serbian Orthodox Church heritage and institutional guarantees for the rights of Kosovo's minorities.  

On July 24, 2006, Ahtisaari brought the parties together in Vienna for the first high-level talks on the status outcome itself.  Serbian President [[Boris Tadić]] and Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]] and Kosovo President [[Fatmir Sejdiu]] and Prime Minister [[Agim Çeku]] attended and presented their respective platforms for Kosovo's future status.  Ahtisaari later told the press that the meeting resulted in no breakthroughs, but that the parties generally listened respectfully to each other's position.  

Ahtisaari briefed Contact Group foreign ministers on September 20, 2006, in New York City at a meeting chaired by U.S. Secretary of state [[Condoleezza Rice]].  At that meeting, the Contact Group released a press statement that reaffirmed its commitment to achieve a negotiated settlement in the course of 2006.  The statement also endorsed Ahtisaari's plans to develop a comprehensive proposal for a status settlement, which he will take to the parties.

Most international observers believe these negotiations will lead to some form of independence &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4489028 Kosovo's status - the wheels grind on]&quot;, ''The Economist'', October 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which Serbian leaders still reject.  The [[Contact Group]] has said in numerous public statements that regardless of status outcome a new international mission will be established in Kosovo to supervise the implementation status settlement and guarantee minority rights.  NATO has also announced its intention to maintain KFOR in Kosovo after the status settlement.

Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] stated in [[September]] [[2006]] that Russia may veto a [[UN Security Council]] proposal on Kosovo's final status that applies different standards than those applied to the separatist [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n regions of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/13/europe/EU_GEN_Russia_Kosovo.php Putin says world should regard Kosovo, separatist Georgian regions on equal footing]&quot;, ''International Herald Tribune'', September 13th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 30th Sept, 2006, the [[Parliament of Serbia|Serbian Parliament]] unanimously adopted a new constitution which describes Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n96849]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;; this Constitution was later adopted after a successful [[Serbian constitutional referendum, 2006|referendum on October 28-29, 2006]]. The UN Civilian Administrator in Kosovo, [[Joachim Rücker]], has argued that this move will have no effect on the final political status of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://kosovareport.blogspot.com/2006/10/un-administrator-says-serbian.html]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, before the referendum, a poll conducted on Aug 26 though Sept 5, 2006 in Serbia suggested that 36 percent expected independence, 29 percent were unsure, 17 percent thought the territory would be split, and 12 percent though it would remain an autonomous region of Serbia.  &lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20060929-0906-serbia-kosovo.html]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==

Kosovo has one of the poorest economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at 1,565 [[Euro]] (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s, poor economic policies, international sanctions, weak access to external trade and finance, and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001 [[GDP]] growth was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of [[GDP]]. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of [[GDP]], and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/enlargement_papers/2005/elp26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNMIK introduced ''de-facto'' an external trade regime and customs administration on September 3, 1999 when it set customs border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported in Kosovo face a flat 10% customs duty fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt; These taxes are collected from all Tax Collection Points installed at the borders of Kosovo, including those between Kosovo and  Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed Free Trade Agreements with [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/globe-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=123&amp;nav_id=37090 Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement], [[B92]], 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia and Hercegovina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosovo-eicc.org/oek/index.php?page_id=64&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonia is Kosovo's largest import and export market (averaging €220 million and €9 million respectively), followed by Serbia-Montenegro (€111 million and €5 million), Germany and Turkey.[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVO/147270-1121700806276/20953280/Kosovo_Economic_Briefing_april.pdf]

The [[Euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and used by UNMIK and the government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian [[Dinar]] is used in the Serbian populated parts.

The economy has been seriously weakened by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm Brussels offers first Kosovo loan]&quot;, BBC News Online, 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.kosovo.undp.org/Projects/TIK/tik.asp Transparency Initiative for Kosovo (TIK)&quot;, UN Development Programme in Kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographic history of Kosovo}}
[[Image:Kosovo ethnic 2005.png|right|thumb|270px|Ethnic composition of Kosovo in [[2005]] according to the [[OSCE]]]]
According to the Kosovo in Figures 2005 Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf  &lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2 million in the following ethnic proportions:
* ''88%'' [[Albanians]] (between 1,972,000 and 2,100,000) 
* ''7%'' [[Serbs]] (between 126,000 and 140,000)	
* ''1.9%'' [[Bosniaks]] (between 34,200 and 38,000) 
* ''1.7%'' [[Roma people|Roma]] (between 30,600 and 34,000) (see also [[Roma in Mitrovica Camps]])
* ''1%'' [[Turkish people|Turks]] (between 18,000 and 20,000)
* ''0,5%'' [[Gorani (Kosovo)|Gorani]] (approx. 10,000)

However, the figures are highly disputable. Some estimates are that there is an Albanian majority well above 90 percent. The population census is set to take place in the near future. Others give much higher figures for Roma and Turks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/news/1999/03/31newsa.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serbianunity.net/news/world_articles/Dragnich1098.html&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a small minority of [[Circassians]] in [[Kosovo Polje]] but they were repatriated to the [[Republic of Adygea]], in Southern [[Russia]]. The ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army is thought to have threatened the Adygs.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/143667.stm BBC News: ''Circassians flee Kosovo conflict''. Sunday, August 2, 1998 Published at 01:01 GMT 02:01 UK&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the Albanians in Kosovo are [[Muslims]] and most Serbs are [[Eastern Orthodox]], even though Kosovo Albanians do not define their national identity through religion. Most of them are non-practising Muslims. About 5% of the Albanians in Kosovo are [[Catholics]]. Atheism is also common among both Albanians and Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1 Religion in Kosovo] - International Crisis Group&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subdivisions ==

== Culture ==
===Music===
[[Music]] has always been part of the [[Albanian]] culture. Although in Kosovo music is diverse (as it got mixed with the cultures of different regimes dominating in Kosovo), authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') does still exist. It is characterized by use of ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''.
In Kosovo, along with modern music, [[folk]] music is very popular. There are many folk [[singers]] and ensembles.  [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well known in Kosovo.
The modern music in Kosovo has its origin from the Western countries. The main modern genres include: [[Pop (music)|Pop]], [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]], [[Rock (music)|Rock]] and [[Jazz]]. The most notable rock bands are: Gjurmët, Troja, Votra, Diadema, Humus, Asgjë sikur Dielli, Kthjellu, [[Cute Babulja]], [[Babilon]], etc. Ilir Bajri is a notable [[jazz]] and [[Electronic Music|electronic]] musician.

[[Leonora Jakupi]] and [[Adelina Ismajli]] are two of the most popular commercial singers in Kosovo today.

There are some notable music festivals in Kosovo:
* ''Rock për Rock'' - contains [[Rock (music)|rock]] and [[Heavy Metal music|metal]] music
