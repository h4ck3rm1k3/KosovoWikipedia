It is the subject of an ongoing territorial dispute between the Serbian government and the province's majority ethnic <a href='Albanian'>Albanian</a> population. It is a part of Serbia, but since the <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a> it has been administered by the <a href='United Nations'>United Nations</a> as a <a href='protectorate'>protectorate</a>. Its Albanian population referred to the province as the </strong>Republic of Kosovo</em>' between <a href='1990'>1990</a> and <a href='1999'>1999</a> and declared it an independent state, though this was recognized abroad only by <a href='Albania'>Albania</a>. The province's final status has yet to be determined; talks on this issue are scheduled for later in <a href='2005'>2005</a>.</p>

The largest cities are <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a> (Albanian: <a href='Prishtina'>Prishtina</a>), the capital, with estimated 500,000 inhabitants, and <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a> in the southwest with 120,000: five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000.</p>
<a name="Geographical_regions"></a><h3>Geographical regions</h3><p><a href='Metohija'>Metohija</a>, called <strong>Rrafshi i Dukagjinit</strong> ("Dukagjin plateau") by Albanians, is the large <a href='basin'>basin</a> at the west of the province. The region includes the towns of &lt;!-- following WD flow --&gt; <a href='Istok'>Istok</a>, <a href='PeÄ'>PeÄ</a>, <a href='DeÄani'>DeÄani</a>, <a href='Djakovica|Äakovica'>Djakovica|Äakovica</a>, <a href='Orahovac'>Orahovac</a>, and <a href='Prizren'>Prizren</a>. The second largest region is <strong>Kosovo</strong>, a basin around the <a href='Sitnica'>Sitnica</a> river containing the cities of <a href='UroÅ¡evac'>UroÅ¡evac</a>, <a href='PriÅ¡tina'>PriÅ¡tina</a>, <a href='VuÄitrn'>VuÄitrn</a>, and <a href='Kosovska Mitrovica'>Kosovska Mitrovica</a>. <strong>Kosovo Polje</strong> (<a href='Kosovo Field'>Kosovo Field</a>) is just a small field which was the site of the <a href='Battle of Kosovo'>Battle of Kosovo</a>; when the communist government changed the name of the province to Kosovo in <a href='1968'>1968</a>, they also started pushing "Kosovo Polje" as the name of entire region. Part of Kosovo along the river <a href='Lab'>Lab</a> which contains the city of <a href='Podujevo'>Podujevo</a> is called <a href='Malo Kosovo'>Malo Kosovo</a> (literally "Little Kosovo"). Just between the Metohia and Kosovo is the <a href='Drenica'>Drenica</a> with the cities of <a href='Srbica'>Srbica</a> and <a href='Klina'>Klina</a> and <a href='MaliÅ¡evo'>MaliÅ¡evo</a>. Around the river <a href='BinaÄka Morava'>BinaÄka Morava</a> is <a href='BinaÄko Pomoravlje'>BinaÄko Pomoravlje</a>. At the southmost tip of the province, along the border with <a href='Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia'>Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia</a> lie the <a href='Gorani|Gora'>Gorani|Gora</a>, <a href='SredaÄka Å½upa'>SredaÄka Å½upa</a> and <a href='SiriniÄka Å½upa'>SiriniÄka Å½upa</a>.</p>
<a name="Name"></a><h2>Name</h2><p>The province is best known as <strong>Kosovo</strong> - this name has been the most widely used by maps and gazetteers within Serbia and abroad. The alternative spelling <em>Kossovo</em> was frequently used until the early <a href='20th century'>20th century</a> and before that, <em>Cassovo</em> or <em>Cassua</em>, an <a href='Italian language|Italianisation'>Italian language|Italianisation</a> of the name.</p>
<p>The name Kosovo (pronounced "KO-so-vo" by <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a>, "ko-SO-vah" by <a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a>) appears to have its roots in the <a href='Slavic peoples|Slavic'>Slavic peoples|Slavic</a> word <em>kos</em> which means "<a href='blackbird'>blackbird</a>". The root word is widely used as a <a href='toponym'>toponym</a> in Slavic countries and the historical <a href='German language|German'>German language|German</a> name for <a href='Kosovo Polje'>Kosovo Polje</a>, <em>Amselfeld</em>, does indeed mean "field of the blackbird". The name "Kosovo" is itself used in other Slavic countries, appearing in <a href='Belarus'>Belarus</a>, <a href='Bosnia'>Bosnia</a>, <a href='Bulgaria'>Bulgaria</a>, <a href='Croatia'>Croatia</a>, and <a href='Russia'>Russia</a> (see <a href='Kosovo (disambiguation)'>Kosovo (disambiguation)</a>).</p>
<p> 
<strong>Kosova</strong> (pronounced "ko-SO-vah") is the <a href='Albanian language|Albanian'>Albanian language|Albanian</a> spelling for the province. Albanians tend to use "Kosova" exclusively in preference to the Serbian name, which many of them reject as a symbol of Serbian dominance. It is also occasionally spelled as <em>KosovÃ«</em>; this is due to the fact that in Albanian, adding the definite article to a noun changes the ending of the word.</p>
<p> 
The Albanian-populated areas of the province and Albania itself tend to use "Kosova" exclusively. "Kosovo" is used, again almost exclusively, in the Serb-populated north of the province and in the rest of the former <a href='Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia'>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia</a>. The international community tries to steer a middle path by referring formally to "Kosovo/Kosova." In practice, however, the Serbian variant is still the most frequently used outside of Kosovo while the Albanian variant is widely used by "internationals" within the province.</p>
<p>The use of the two alternative names is a highly sensitive political issue for both Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, who regard the use of the other side's name as being a denial of their own side's territorial rights (in much the same way that <a href='Macedonian Slavs|Macedonians'>Macedonian Slavs|Macedonians</a> and <a href='Greece|Greeks'>Greece|Greeks</a> have disputed the name of the <a href='Republic of Macedonia'>Republic of Macedonia</a>). During the <a href='Kosovo War'>Kosovo War</a>, <a href='United States'>United States</a> President <a href='Bill Clinton'>Bill Clinton</a> was criticised for frequently using "Kosova" and appearing to pronounce "Kosovo" the Albanian way, putting the emphasis on the middle syllable rather than on the first syllable as in the Serbian pronunciation. This may, however, have been a simple mispronunciation.</p>
<p><strong>Metohia</strong> (alternatively spelled <em>Metohija</em>) derives from the <a href='Greek language|Greek'>Greek language|Greek</a> word <em>Î¼ÎµÏÏÏÎ¹Î±</em> (<em>metochia</em>), a term which denotes <a href='church'>church</a>-owned land. Historically, the estates of the <a href='Serbian Orthodox Church'>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> were located principally in this region. The name does not indicate a modern administrative district. Albanians tend not to use the name and instead prefer to call it <em>Rrafshi i Dukagjinit</em>, the "Dukagjin plateau".</p>
<p>Some Kosovo Albanians refer to Kosovo as <a href='Dardania (Europe)|Dardania'>Dardania (Europe)|Dardania</a>, the name of the ancient Roman province which covered the territory of modern Kosovo and part of the Republic of Macedonia. Kosovo President <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>Ibrahim Rugova</a> has been an enthusiastic backer of a "Dardanian" identity and his flag and presidential seal refer to this notional identity. However, it is not recognised by any international power and the name "Kosova" remains more widely used among the Albanian population.</p>

<a name="Adjective_form"></a><h3>Adjective form</h3><p>The question of what to call the inhabitants of Kosovo collectively has also aroused some debate. They have been called variously "Kosovars", "Kosovans" and "Kosovians". The two words accepted by the <a href='Oxford English Dictionary'>Oxford English Dictionary</a> are "Kosovar" (borrowed from Albanian), the most widely used variant in English, by a long way, and "Kosovan" (using the English rules for <a href='demonym'>demonyms</a>) much less used. "Kosovian" is considered a non-standard word and very little used at all.</p>
<p>As Kosovo has no formal statehood, current international usage is to refer to Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians. Most of the Albanian-descended community in Kosovo would prefer the use of Kosovar or Kosovan because of the attendant political overtones, whilst the Serb minority continue to think of themselves as Serb or Serbian (from Kosovo).</p>
<a name="Kosovo_placenames"></a><h3>Kosovo placenames</h3><p>Most localities in Kosovo have distinct Serbian and Albanian placenames, nearly all very similar, some differing radically, Like that of Ferizaj, for example. It went from Ferizaj to Ferizovic and eventually changed into UroÅ¡evac. During the Serbian administration of 1912-1999, Kosovo localities were known internationally almost exclusively by their Serbian names.</p>
<p>Since the United Nations took over administration of the province in June 1999, the administration and some international organisations have adopted a policy of treating both versions equally. For the sake of convenience, this article gives alternative placenames the first time a locality is mentioned, but will use the more familiar Serbian version thereafter. A useful list of Serbian and Albanian forms of Kosovo placenames is available <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/*/http%3A//www.osce.org/kosovo/documents/reports/hr/part1/p5app.htm here'>1</a> from the <a href='Internet Archive'>Internet Archive</a>'s Wayback Machine, as the original page is missing.</p>
<a name="Flag"></a><h2>Flag</h2><p>The province never had an official flag of its own. The <a href='Flag of Albania|Albanian flag'>Flag of Albania|Albanian flag</a> is used by the Albanian-dominated administration and the vast majority of Kosovo Albanians. Kosovo's president, Ibrahim Rugova, has proposed an alternative flag of "Dardania" based on the design of the Albanian flag, but even within Kosovo it is little used. The Serb-inhabited area of north Kosovo uses only the <a href='flag of Serbia and Montenegro'>flag of Serbia and Montenegro</a>, which is formally the flag of the whole of Serbia including Kosovo, although this usage is rejected by virtually all Kosovo Albanians. The United Nations administration in Kosovo intends to establish a new flag for the province, which will undoubtedly be very different from the two national communities' existing flags. The current <a href='flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina'>flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> emerged from a similar process of national reconciliation.</p>
<a name="History"></a><h2>History</h2><p><em>See <a href='History of Kosovo'>History of Kosovo</a>.</em></p>
<a name="Politics_and_international_status"></a><h2>Politics and international status</h2><p>{{Politics of Kosovo}}
Kosovo's international status is anomalous in that although it is a province of the Republic of  employees from all ethnic communities (Albanian, Serbian, Roma, Bosniac, etc), but dominated by veterans of the <a href='KLA'>KLA</a>. It also manages the province's railways and airline (<a href='Kosova Airlines'>Kosova Airlines</a>). The airspace of the province is controlled by KFOR. UNMIK uses the United Nations flag.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Framework enacted by the Kosovo assembly (with UNMIK approval) has adopted a  this does not rule out that they might violate this principle in the case of Serbia.</p>
<p>   
Questions have also been raised about whether an independent Kosovo would be politically or economically viable, given the small size of the province and its feeble economy.</p>
<a name="Administrative_subdivisions"></a><h2>Administrative subdivisions</h2><p><em>Main article: <a href='Subdivisions of Serbia and Montenegro'>Subdivisions of Serbia and Montenegro</a></em></p>
<p><a href='Image:Kosovo-Municipalities.png|thumb|300px|right|Municipalities of Kosovo'>Image:Kosovo-Municipalities.png|thumb|300px|right|Municipalities of Kosovo</a></p>
<p>Administratively, Kosovo is divided in <a href='district'>districts</a> (<em><a href='okrug'>okrug</a></em>) which are further divided into <a href='municipality|municipalities'>municipality|municipalities</a> (<em><a href='opstina'>opstina</a></em>). After establishing of <a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a>, district and municipal governments were relocated outside of the province (<a href='http://www.yugoslavembassy.org.uk/eng/consular/passports.html list'>2</a>), where they still operate. Meanwhile, UNMIK has set up its administration according to the same subdivisions though with some alterations (notably, merging municipalities of <a href='municipality of Gora|Gora'>municipality of Gora|Gora</a> and <a href='municipality of Opolje|Opolje'>municipality of Opolje|Opolje</a> into one municipality of <a href='municipality of DragaÅ¡|DragaÅ¡'>municipality of DragaÅ¡|DragaÅ¡</a>). They do not precisely parallel the administrative subdivisions set up by the parallel ethnic Albanian government. The Kosovo Government and Assembly are planning to reconcile this and implement broad devolution throughout the province.</p>
<a name="Currency"></a><h2>Currency</h2><p><a href='UNMIK'>UNMIK</a> declared the <a href='euro'>euro</a> to be official currency of the province in <a href='2001'>2001</a> in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the <a href='Deutschmark'>Deutschmark</a>, which had become <em>de facto</em> currency even before the 1999 war. However, the <a href='Serbian dinar'>Serbian dinar</a> remains an official currency, though used principally by the <a href='Kosovo Serb enclaves'>Kosovo Serb enclaves</a>; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro, Kosovo's administration uses euros exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the <a href='United States dollar'>United States dollar</a> and <a href='Swiss franc'>Swiss franc</a> are the most widespread.</p>
<a name="Demographics"></a><h2>Demographics</h2><p><em>Main article: <a href='Demographic history of Kosovo'>Demographic history of Kosovo</a></em></p>
<p><a href='Albanians'>Albanians</a> now comprise an almost 90% majority of the population of the province. Their percentage as a proportion of the province's population has increased steadily over time as a result of a high birth rate, Albanian immigration and non-Albanian emigration. Most of the province's population became refugees during the war but most of the Albanian refugees quickly returned to their homes at its end. In the aftermath of the conflict, several hundred thousand non-Albanians, especially <a href='Serbs'>Serbs</a> and <a href='Roma (people)|Romas'>Roma (people)|Romas</a>, fled the province to escape renewed intercommunal violence. The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall in recent years due to a combination of economic hardship and ethnic tension.</p>
<p>According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo<a href='http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf'>3</a>, Kosovo's total population is approximately 1,970,000 with the following ethnic proportions:</p>
<ul>
<li>88% Albanians (1,733,600)</li>
<li> 
7% Serbs (137,900)</li>
<li> 
1.9% Muslim Slavs (37,400)</li>
<li> 
1.7% Roma (33,500)</li>
<li> 
1% Turks (19,700)</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
Intercommunal violence has further reduced the number of non-Albanians in Kosovo since this survey, and many of those who do remain now live in refugee camps or in heavily guarded villages.</p>
