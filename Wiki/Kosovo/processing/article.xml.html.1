<p>]The Ottoman conquest of Kosovo was a major achievement for the Turks, as the Kosovar rich minerals would prove a great asset to their empire[&lt;]!-- citation needed --[&gt;]. The Turkish achievement in those years was not merely a military one. Whatever the glory of the medieval Balkan principalities may have been before the tragedy of Kosovo, conditions of order had already begun to break down in the Balkans before the Turks ever came. In the first centuries of Turkish rule, conditions of public order markedly improved.[&lt;]ref[&gt;]http:\/\/cgi.stanford.edu\/group\/wais\/cgi-bin\/index.php?p=2059[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;]The establishment of Ottoman institutions in Kosovo brought about a new era. Religiously-selective taxation (see[ <a href='Jizya'>]Jizya[<\/a>]), education of the Kosovar aristocracy in Ottoman schools (see[ <a href='Enderun School'>]Enderun School[<\/a>]) and the stability brought to the region led to a mass conversion of the Christian population into[ <a href='Islam'>]Islam[<\/a>]. The truth is that the Turks were largely indifferent in the matters of religion, although, fearing that the religions of their subjects might serve as focal points of resistance, they forbade the building of all but the meanest churches, and likewise outlawed the ringing of church bells.Thus, the new religion was embraced by approximately two-thirds of the Albanians and a portion of the Serbs..[][<\/p>

His engagement in the national cause culminated in 1689, when he raised a 20,000-member army comprised of Christian and Muslim Albanians, who joined the Austrians in their war against Turkey. The campaign resulted in a brief liberation of Kosovo, but after a plague breakout among Austrians and Kosovars, the Turks soon recovered all their lost areas.

]{{Politics of Kosovo}}[
]In 1999,[ <a href='United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244'>]United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|UN Security Council Resolution 1244[<\/a> ]placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration pending a determination of Kosovo's future status. This Resolution entrusted the[ <a href='United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo'>]United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo[<\/a> ](UNMIK) with sweeping powers to govern Kosovo, but also directed UNMIK to establish interim institutions of self-governance. Resolution 1244 permits Serbia no role in governing Kosovo and since 1999 Serbian laws and institutions have not been valid in Kosovo. NATO has a separate mandate to provide for a safe and secure environment..[][<\/p>
<p>]In May 2001, UNMIK promulgated the Constitutional Framework, which established Kosovo's[ <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>]Provisional Institutions of Self-Government[<\/a> ](PISG). The PISG replaced the[ <a href='Joint Interim Administrative Structure'>]Joint Interim Administrative Structure[<\/a> ](JIAS) established a year earlier. Since 2001, UNMIK has been gradually transferring increased governing competencies to the PISG, while reserving some powers that are normally carried out by sovereign states, such as foreign affairs. Kosovo has also established municipal government and an internationally-supervised Kosovo Police Service..[][<\/p>
<p>]According to the Constitutional Framework, Kosovo shall have a 120-member Kosovo Assembly. The Assembly includes twenty reserved seats: ten for Kosovo Serbs and ten for non-Serb minorities (Bosniaks, Roma, etc). The Kosovo Assembly is responsible for electing a President and Prime Minister of Kosovo..[][<\/p>
<p>]The largest political party in Kosovo, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), has its origins in the 1990s non-violent resistance movement to MiloÅ¡evic's rule. The party was led by Ibrahim Rugova until his death in 2006. The two next largest parties have their roots in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA): the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) led by former KLA leader Hashim Thaci and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK) led by former KLA commander Ramush Haradinaj. Kosovo publisher Veton Surroi formed his own political party in 2004 named "Ora." Kosovo Serbs formed the Serb List for Kosovo and Metohija (SLKM) in 2004, but have boycotted Kosovo's institutions and never taken their seats in the Kosovo Assembly..[][<\/p>
<p>]In November 2001, the[ <a href='OSCE'>]OSCE[<\/a> ]supervised the first elections for the Kosovo Assembly. After that election, Kosovo's political parties formed an all-party unity coalition and elected[ <a href='Ibrahim Rugova'>]Ibrahim Rugova[<\/a> ]as President and Bajram Rexhepi (PDK) as Prime Minister..[][<\/p>
<p>]After Kosovo-wide elections in October 2004, the LDK and AAK formed a new governing coalition that did not include PDK and Ora. This coalition agreement resulted in[ <a href='Ramush Haradinaj'>]Ramush Haradinaj[<\/a> ](AAK) becoming Prime Minister, while Ibrahim Rugova retained the position of President. PDK and Ora were critical of the coalition agreement and have since frequently accused the current government of corruption..[][<\/p>
<p><a href='Image:Coat of arms of the PISG of Kosovo.svg|thumb|100px|left|The \[\[Approved logo of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|Approved Logo'>]Image:Coat of arms of the PISG of Kosovo.svg|thumb|100px|left|The \[\[Approved logo of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|Approved Logo[<\/a> ]of the[ <a href='Provisional Institutions of Self-Government'>]Provisional Institutions of Self-Government[<\/a>]\]\][
]Ramush Haradinaj resigned the post of Prime Minister after he was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in March 2005. He was replaced by Bajram Kosumi (AAK). But in a political shake-up after the death of President Rugova in January 2006, Kosumi himself was replaced by former Kosovo Protection Corps commander[ <a href='Agim Ceku'>]Agim Ceku[<\/a>]. Ceku has won recognition for his outreach to minorities, but Serbia has been critical of his wartime past as military leader of the KLA and claims he is still not doing enough for Kosovo Serbs. The Kosovo Assembly elected[ <a href='Fatmir Sejdiu'>]Fatmir Sejdiu[<\/a>], a former LDK parliamentarian, president after Rugova's death. SlaviÅ¡a Petkovic, Minister for Communities and Returns, was previously the only ethnic Serb in the government, but resigned in November 2006 amid allegations that he misused ministry funds.[&lt;]ref[&gt;]"[<a href='http:\/\/www.adnki.com\/index_2Level_English.php?cat=Politics&amp;loid=8.0.363650179&amp;par=0 Kosovo: Serb minister resigns over misuse of funds'>]22[<\/a> ]", Adnkronos international (AKI), November 27, 2006[&lt;]\/ref[&gt;&lt;]ref[&gt;]"[<a href='http:\/\/www.reliefweb.int\/rw\/RWB.NSF\/db900SID\/LZEG-6VUQUS?OpenDocument Sole Kosovo Serb cabinet minister resigns: PM'>]23[<\/a> ]", Agence France-Presse (AFP), November 24, 2006.[&lt;]\/ref[&gt; ]Today two of the total thirteen ministries in Kosovo's Government have ministers from the minorities.
