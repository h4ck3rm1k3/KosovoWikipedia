'''Kosovo''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''Kosovë''/''Kosova'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Косово и Метохија/''Kosovo i Metohija'') is a [[UN]]-administered province of [[Serbia]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. By the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (adopted in 1999), Kosovo is defined as autonomous province within former [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] under UN administration. Whether this will remain the case is still unclear, as the final status of Kosovo is the subject of an ongoing dispute between government of Serbia and Kosovo's government. Talks on this issue started in Vienna, on February 20, [[2006]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/news.htm#1703 Kosovo, Serbian delegations hold new status talks under UN chairmanship]&lt;/ref&gt;. Nevertheless, in the same resolution, the UN &quot;reafirms the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other States of the region&quot;&lt;ref&gt;UN Security Council Resolution S/RES/1244(1999) of 2 June 1999 (S/1999/649, annex 2 to this resolution)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Geography ==
[[image:UTkosovo rel small 92.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Physical map of Kosovo]]
With an area of [[1 E10 m²|10,912]] [[square kilometre]]s (4,213 [[square mile|sq.&amp;nbsp;mi]]) and a population of over two million of the eve of the 1999 crisis, Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Serbia proper]] to the North and East; [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the south, and [[Albania]] to the southwest. The largest cities are [[Prishtinë]]/[[Pristina]] the capital, with an estimated 500,000 citizens, and [[Prizren]] in the southwest with 120,000 citizens; five other towns have populations in excess of 50,000. The name [[Metohija]] is used by mostly [[Serbs]] for the western part of the land. [[Albanians]] refer to the area as ''Rrafshi i Dukagjinit''.

== History ==
{{main|History of Kosovo}}
=== Ancient ===
There is a theory that the region of Kosovo has been inhabited by [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribes]] since the [[Bronze Age]]. In ancient times the area has been known as [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] and was settled by a tribe with the same name. The south of Kosovo was ruled by [[Macedonia]] since Alexander the Great's reign in the 4th century BC. The [[Dardani]] were of Illyrian or Thracian stock. Illyrians organised resistance against [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for hundreds of years but after the long wars of Illyrian tribes against intruders, the region was later occupied by the [[Roman Empire]] under Emperor [[Augustus]]. When the Roman Empire split in [[Anno Domini|A.D.]]&amp;nbsp;[[395]], the area of Kosovo came under the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]].

=== Medieval - The arrival of Serbs, the unified Serbian Lands and the Serb Kingdom ===
[[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], or [[Serbs]] in precise, came to the territories of roughly modern-day Kosovo in the [[6th century|6th]]-[[7th century]]. They were invited to settle in the area south of [[Danube]] as farmers by Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] to protect the area from invading [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]]. The slavs were [[Christianization|Christianized]] in several waves between the [[7th century|7th]] and [[9th century]] with the last wave taking place between [[867]] and [[874]]. But by then Kosovo proper was ruled by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] and [[Byzantines]] from the 850s until [[1014]], while [[Metohija]] became a part of the [[Principality of Rascia]]. 

The [[Serbs]] begin the takeover of Kosovo in the [[11th century]] under a branch of the [[House of Vojislavljević|House of Voislav]] as the [[Grand Prince|Grand Princes]] of [[Rascia]]. In [[1093]], Prince Vukan advanced all the way to [[Lipljan]], burned it down and raided the neighbouring areas. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] himself came to [[Zvečan]] for negotiations. A peace was concluded, but Vukan broke it and defeated the army of John Comnenus, the Emperor's nephew. His armies stormed Kosovo. Byzantine Emperor Alexius had to come to Lipljan in [[1094]] and negotiate again. Peace was concluded and Vukan gave hostages to the Emperor, including his nephews Uroš and Stefan Vukan. Prince Vukan renewed the warring in [[1106]], once again defeating John Comnenus' army, but Vukan's following death put a halt to a total conquest of Kosovo. 

In [[1166]] - [[1168]], a [[Serbs|Serbian]] nobleman from [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]], [[Stefan Nemanja]], the founder of the [[Nemanjić|House of Nemanja]] asserted to the [[Rascia]]n Grand Princely throne and conquered most of Kosovo in an uprising against the [[Byzantine Emperor]]. He defeated the previous [[Grand Prince]], his brother, Tihomir's army at [[Pantino]]. Tihomir was drowned in the [[Sitnica]] river. Nemanja was eventually defeated and had to return some of his conquests, and vouched to the [[Byzantine Emperor]] that he would not raise his hand against him. In [[1183]], Nemanja embarked on a new offensive with the Hungarians after the Byzantine Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus]] death. 

Nemanja's son, [[Stefan Prvovenčani|Stephen II the First-crowned of Nemanja]], recorded Nemanja's conquests, as Nemanja restored Kosovo from the [[Greeks]], the border of the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] reaching the river of [[Lab]]. Grand Prince Stephen II finished the inclusion of the Kosovo territories in [[1208]], by which time he had conquered [[Prizren]] and [[Lipljan]], and moved the border of his realm to the [[Šar mountain]].

In [[1217]], the [[History of Serbia|Serbian Kingdom]] achieved recognition. In [[1219]], an autocephalous [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] was created, with the [[Hvosno]], [[Prizren]] and [[Lipljan]] [[Bishoprics|Episcoprics]] on Kosovo. By the end of the [[13th century]], the centre of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Church]] was moved to [[Peć]] from [[Žiča]].

In the [[13th century]], Kosovo becomes the heart of the Serbian political and religious life with the Šar mountain becoming the political center of the Serbian rulers. The main chatteu was that in [[Pauni]]. On an island was [[Svrčin]] and on the coast [[Štimlji]], and in the mountains was the Castle of [[Nerodimlje]]. The Complexes were used for counciling, crowning of rulers, negotiating and as the rulers' living quarters. After [[1291]], the [[Tartars]] broke all the way to [[Peć]]. [[List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King]] [[Stefan Milutin]] managed to defeat them and then chase them further. He raised the Temple of the [[Mother of Christ]] of Ljeviška in [[Prizren]] around [[1307]], which became the seat of the Prizren Episcopric and the magnificent [[Gračanica]] in [[1335]], the seat of the [[Lipljan]] Episcopric. In 1331, Juvenille King Dušan attacked his father, Serbian King Stefan of Dechani at his castle in [[Nerodimlje]]. King Stefan closed in his neighbouring fortress of [[Petrič]], but Dušan captures him and closed him with his second wife Maria Palailogos and their children in [[Zvečan]], where the dethroned King died on [[11 November]] [[1331]]. 

In [[1327]] and [[1328]], [[List of Serbian rulers|Serbian King]] [[Stefan Dečanski|Stefan of Dechani]] started forming the vast [[Dečani]] domain, although, Serbian King [[Stefan Dušan|Dušan]] would finish it in [[1335]]. Stefan of Dechani issued that ''Dechani Charter'' in [[1330]]. Listing every single citizen in every household under the Church Land's demesne. 

==== Serbian Empire and Despotate ====
[[Monarch|King]] and [[Tsar]] [[Stefan Dušan]] founded the vast Monastery of Saint Archaengel near [[Prizren]] in [[1342]]-[[1352]]. King Dušan declared himself as ''Emperor of Serbs and Greeks'' in [[1345]], thereby starting the [[Serbian Empire]]. Stefan Dušan received John Cantakuzines in [[1342]] in his Castle in [[Pauni]] to discuss a joint War against the Byzantine Emperor. In [[1346]], the Serbian [[Archbishopric|Archepiscopric]] at Peć was upgraded into a Patriarchate, but not recognized before [[1370]]. 

After the [[Serbian Empire]] fell into disarray prior to his death in [[1355]], feudal anarchy caught up with the country during the reign of Tsar [[Stefan Uroš V]]. Kosovo became a domain of the [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević|House of Mrnjavčević]], but Prince Voislav Voinović expanded his demesne further onto Kosovo. The armies of King [[Vukašin Mrnjavčević]] from [[Priština]] and his allies defeated Voislav's forces in [[1369]], putting a halt to his advances. After the Battle of Marica on [[26 September]] [[1371]] in which the Mrnjavčević brothers lost their lives, [[House of Balšić|Đurađ I Balšić]] of [[Zeta (state)|Zeta]] took [[Prizren]] and [[Peć]] in [[1372]]. A part of Kosovo became the demesne of the [[Prince Lazar|House of Lazarević]].

The [[Ottomans]] invaded the Serbian Realm and met the coalition of South East European nobility on [[28 June]] [[1389]], near [[Priština]], at Gazi Mestan. The [[Serbian]] Army was assisted by various allies. The epic [[Battle of Kosovo]] followed, in which Prince Lazar himself lost his life. Prince Lazar amassed 70,000 men on the battlefield and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had 140,000. Through the cunning of [[Miloš Obilić]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad]] was murdered and the new Sultan [[Beyazid]] had, despite winning the battle, to retreat to consolidate his power. The Ottoman Sultan was buried with one of his sons at Gazi Mestan. Both [[Prince Lazar]] and [[Miloš Obilić]] were canonised by the [[Serbian Ortodox Church]] for their efforts in the battle. The local House of [[Vuk Branković|Branković]] came to prominence as the local lords of Kosovo, under [[Vuk Branković]], with the temporary fall of the [[History of Serbia|Serbian Despotate]] in [[1439]]. Another great battle occurred between the Hungarian troops supported by (self-proclaimed King) Gjergj Kastrioti [[Skanderbeg]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops supported by the Brankovićs in [[1448]]. Skanderbeg's troops which were going to help John Hunyadi were stopped by the Brankovic's troops, who was more or less a Turkish [[Vassal]]. Hungarian King [[John Hunyadi]] lost the battle after a 2-day fight, but essentially stopped the Ottoman advance northwards. Kosovo then became vassalaged to the [[Ottoman Empire]], until its direct incorporation after the final fall of Serbia in [[1459]]. 

In [[1455]], new castles arise in [[Priština]] and [[Vučitrn]], centres of the Ottoman vassalaged [[Vuk Branković|House of Branković]].

=== Ottomans and Albanian national movements ===
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islamisation]] with them, particularly in towns, and later also created the [[Viyalet of Kosovo]] as one of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territorial entities. This brought a great shift, as the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Serb]] population began to lose its majority when masses of [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Albanians]] ([[Muslims]]) moved to Kosovo. During the Islamisation many Churches and Holy [[Orthodox Christian]] places were raised to the ground or turned in to [[Mosques]]. The big Monastery of Saint Archangel near [[Prizren]] was teared down at the end of the 16th [[century]] and the material used to build the [[Mosque]] of [[Sinan-pasha]], an Islamized [[Serb]], in Prizren. Kosovo was taken by the Austrian forces during the Great War of [[1683]] - [[1699]] with help of 5,000 Albanians and their leader, a [[Catholic Archibishop]] [[Pjetër Bogdani]]. The archbishop died of plague during the war, and his grave was later reopened, with his body scattered and given to the dogs by the Ottomans because of his role in the rebellion. In [[1690]], the [[Serbian Patriarch of Peć]] [[Arsenije III]], who previously escaped a certain death, led 37,000 families from Kosovo, to evade [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] wrath since Kosovo had just been retaken by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The people that followed him were probably mostly [[Serbs]], but some Orthodox Albanians and others too. 20,000 Serbs abandoned [[Prizren]] alone. Due to the terror from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo and Metohija area continued throughout the [[18th century]]. It is also noted that some [[Serbs]] adopted [[Islam]] and some even gradually fused with the predominantly Albanian Moslems and adopted their culture and even language. By the [[19th century]], [[Albanians]] replaced the [[Serbs]] as the dominating nation of Kosovo. 

Refugees from territories conquered in the [[1876]]-[[1877]] Serbo-Turkish war and [[1877]]-[[1878]] Russo-Turkish war inhabited almost every Kosovo and Macedonian town escaping from the Serbian army and population were committing against unarmed civilians. These populations are now known as 'muhaxher' (which means 'refugee') and are the ancestors of many who are still known by their same surnames, ''Muhaxheri''. It is also estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 ''Serbs'' were cleansed out of the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] between [[1876]] and [[1912]], especially during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greek-Ottman War]] in [[1897]]. (see [[Demographic history of Kosovo]])

Albanians formed the [[League of Prizren]] in [[Prizren]] in the [[19th century]]. Hundreds of Albanian leaders from all over Albania gathered and discussed the urgent issues concerning them. They successfully opposed any Serbian invasion attempts. Serbia complained to the Western Powers that the promised territories were not being held because Ottomans were hesitating to do that. Western Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting against Albanians. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl Frashëri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. In [[1910]], an [[Albanian]] uprising spread from [[Prishtina]] and lasted until the Ottoman Sultan's visit to Kosovo in [[June]] [[1911]]. The Aim of the League of Prizren as to unite the four Albanian Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one Albanian State. However at that time Serbs have consisted about ''40%'' of Kosovo's overall population and were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with other Slavs and Turks in Kosovo.

=== Restoration of Serbian rule ===
:''See also:[[Serbia in WWI]]''
In [[1912]] during the [[Balkan Wars]], most of Kosovo was conquered by [[Serbia]] while [[Metohija]] was captured by [[Montenegro]]. And exodus of the local Moslem, especially Albanian population occured. This is best described by [[Leon Trotsky]], who was the reporter for the 'Pravda' newspaper at the time. The Serbian authorities planned a recolonization of Kosovo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsie.de/pdf/B2002GatheringClouds.pdf Elsie, R. (ed.) (2002): ''Gathering Clouds. The roots of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Early twentieth-century documents''. Dukagjini Balkan Books, Peċ (Kosovo). ISBN 9951-05-016-6&lt;/ref&gt;. In the winter of [[1915]]-[[1916]] Kosovo saw a large exodus of its [[Serbia]]n population and army; hundreds of thousands soldiers have died of starvation, extreme weather and Albanian reprisals as they were approaching the [[Allies]] in [[Corfu]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. 

==== Yugoslavia and fascist Albania ====
The [[1918]]-[[1929]] period of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] witnessed a raise of the Serbian population in the region and decline in the non-Serbian. After the [[1929]]-[[1941]] [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] which introduced the ''[[Yugoslav]]'' nationality unifying all Kosovan [[Slavs]], the Kingdom was invaded by the [[Axis forces]]. The greatest part of Kosovo became a part of [[Italy|Italian]]-controlled [[Greater Albania|Fascist Albania]], and smaller bits by the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-[[Fascist]] [[Greater Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany|German]]-occupied [[Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]]. Since the Albanians had decided in the [[Conference of Bujan]] that Kosovo would remain Albanian, they have started immediately an ethnic cleansing of the non-Albanians in the occupied Kosovo. The infamous [[21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian)|SS Division Skanderbeg]] is known to committed horrible crimes. Tens of thousands of Serbs lost their lives and around 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the war. Hundreds of thousands more would leave in the following decades, following the shift of power in Kosovo. Around 10,000 Serbs died in Albanian extermination camps by the hand of military squadrons like the [[Vipurii]]. Prior to the surrender of [[History of Italy|Fascist Italy]] in [[1943]], the German forces took over direct control of their region. After numerious uprisings of the [[Serbian]] [[Chetniks]] and [[Yugoslav]] [[Partisans]], Kosovo was liberated after [[1944]] with the help of the [[Red Army]] of the Comintern, and became a province of ''Kosovo and Metohija'' of one of the Republics of the [[Yugoslavia|Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]], [[Serbia]]. 

The Province of Kosovo and Metohija was formed autonomous to protect its regional [[Albanians|Albanian]] majority withing the [[History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia]] as a member of the [[SFRJ|Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] in [[1945]] under the strong dictatorship of the former Partisan leader, [[Josip Broz Tito]], but with a strictly limited status. Prior to Yugoslavia's name change to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Serbia's to the [[History of Serbia|Socialist Republic of Serbia]] in [[1963]], the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija gained more inner autonomy. In the [[1974]] constitution, the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles - President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a ''de facto'' Socialist Republic within the SFRJ, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Region within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] were defined official on the Provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: [[Serbs]] and [[Albanians]]. In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement for more freedom desired full recognition of the Province of Kosovo and Metohija as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's arbitrary regime dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution. The enthic composure of Kosovo and Metohija witnessed unproportional increase as the number of [[Albanians]] trippled gradually rising from almost ''65%'' to over ''80%'' and the number [[Serbs]] barelly increasing and dropping in the full share of the total population from some ''25%'' down to ''10%''.

In [[1981]] the Kosovar Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia. Those protests were harshly attacked by the Serbian government. In [[1986]], the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts published a document [[Memorandum]] which contained heavily Serbian nationalist propaganda, based on both true and unendingly exaggerated individual events and historical suffers of the Serbian people. They were criticising the ethnic strifes in the province and the disintegration of the Yugoslav economy into separate economic sectors and territories, which was transforming the federal state into a loose confederation. During this time, [[Slobodan Milošević]]s rise to power started in [[Serbia]].

==== Unrests in Kosovo ====
''see also: [[Kosovo War]]''&lt;br&gt;
In [[1989]], following Milošević's rise of power (especially the Gazimestan gathering, marking 600 years from the [[Battle of Kosovo]]) the autonomy of Kosovo was revoked. Milosevic, however, did not remove Kosovo's seat from the Federal Presidency, installing in it his own supporters to seize more power in the Federal government. Most Albanians organized a peaceful resistance movement. Most Albanians were expelled from their jobs, Albanian schools and the medical care system were shut down, and Kosovo was put under an effective [[apartheid]]. 

On July 2, [[1990]] Kosovo parliament declared Kosovo an independent country. In September of that year, the parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of [[Kaçanik]], adopted the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. Two years later, Kosovo organized a referendum which was observed by international organisations but was not recognized internationally. With an 80% turnout, 98% voted for Kosovo to be independent. In January, [[1992]] Albanians in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] also voted for autonomy and independence in parts of western Macedonia. In the early nineties, Albanians organized a parallel state system which managed the non-violent resistance movement and organized a parallel system of education and healthcare, among other things.With the events in [[Bosnia]] and [[Croatia]] coming to an end, the Serb government started moving some of the Serbian refugees from Croatia and Bosnia to Kosovo. &lt;!-- started moving all of the refugees?? leave the word &quot;some of the refugees&quot; --&gt;In a number of cases, Albanian families were expelled from their apartments to make space for the refugees.

After the [[Dayton]] Agreement in [[1995]], Albanians organized into the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. Yugoslav forces allegedly committed war crimes in Kosovo, although the Serbian government claims that the army was only going after suspected Albanian &quot;terrorists&quot;. This triggered a 78-day [[NATO]] campaign in [[1999]]. During the conflict, some 12,000 Kosovars were killed, of whome 9,000-10,000 were [[Albanians]] and 1,000-2,000 others ([[Serbs]] and [[Roma]]) and up to 700,000 Albanians and over 100,000 Serbs expelled. Some 3,000 Albanians are still missing. The number of Serbian soldier, policemen, and civilian deaths is considered to be around 3,000, but it's also disputed to be much more, as 2,800 people of Serb origin are still missing, believed dead. According to OSCE numbers and Kosovar Albanian sources on population size and distribution, an estimated 45.7 percent of the Albanian population and 59.5 percent of the Serb population had fled Kosovo during the bombings (i.e. from 23 March to 9 June 1999). 

With the arrival of NATO, a large number of Serbs fled the region, estimated at 100,000 by the UNHCR. Around 120,000 remain in Kosovo and oppose any rule by Albanians. Up to 300,000 non-Albanians (mostly [[Serbs]]) fled Kosovo. This instills fear within the Albanians and makes them oppose return projects. Some 20,000 came back, mainly rural Serbs, while urban Serbs have largely integrated into Serbia and will not go back to Kosovo regardless of what their status will be. Many Serbs fear to return to their homes since it's proven not to be safe for them, even with [[UNMIK]] protection, notably the [[Unrest in Kosovo|unrest in 2004]], when 900 Serbian houses were burned and other property destroyed while the Serbian populace was 
closed into enclaves and had to concentrate to the north of Kosovo until today, causing a wave of 3,500 Serbian refugees. Among the numerious [[UNESCO]] World Heritage sites destroyed by the Albanian para-military forces is King [[Stefan Milutin]]'s grave, [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]] [[Orthodox]] [[Cathedral]] from the [[12th century]] in [[Prizren]]. In total, 156 Orthodox Churches and Monasteries were destroyed during the [[unrest in Kosovo]]. Many of the Churches and Monasteries were dating back to the [[12th century|12th]], [[13th century|13th]] and [[14th century|14th]] century.

The Status talks started in February 2006, it is set to end in the course of the year. The security of the minorities, must be provided by Kosovo Albanian governments, but it is disputed if the Kosovo Albanian Institutions can grant these guarantees. The [[EU]] still is said that they will not raise any demands for an independent Kosovo.

== Economy ==
[[UNMIK]] declared the [[euro]] to be the official currency of the province in [[2001]] in the course of implementing a currency reform. This was undertaken to replace the previous widespread use of the [[Deutschmark]], which had become the ''de facto'' currency even before the 1999 war. However, the [[Serbian dinar]] remains an official currency, used principally in the [[Kosovo Serb enclaves]]; it is only used sporadically outside of them. Most trade is conducted using the euro; Kosovo's administration uses the euro exclusively, and all commercial banks use the euro as the primary currency. Of other international currencies, the [[United States dollar]] and [[Swiss franc]] are the most widespread.

== Demographics ==
Ethnic Albanians comprise almost 90% of the population of the province. In the aftermath of the conflict some one thousand non-Albanians, particularly [[Serbs]] and [[Roma]] either followed Serb soldiers as they withdrew, were forcibly expelled by the Albanian majority or fled the province to escape perceived threats of revenge by Albanians. The non-Albanian population of Kosovo has continued to fall since the arrival of NATO and the UN as a result of violence, perceived intimidation, and economic hardship. Many still live in communal camps in [[Serbia]] or [[Macedonia]] cared for by international relief agencies. However, there have been many attempts by Kosovo's government to resettle non-Albanians in the region which have largely been successful, including the resettlement of well over one thousand Serbians and Roma from 2004 - 2005. The Kosovo government has been widely praised for paying for the rebuilding of Serb houses in the aftermath of the 2004 riots. This has been marked as the first case of reparations in the history of the Balkans. 

According to the 2000 Living Standard Measurement Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo[http://www.sok-kosovo.org/pdf/population/Kosovo_population.pdf], Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1,8 and 2,0 million in the following ethnic proportions:
* ''88%'' [[Albanians]] (between 1,584,000 and 1,733,600) 
* ''7%'' [[Serbs]] (between 126,000 and 140,000)	
* ''3%'' [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] and [[Bosniaks]] (54 to 60 thousand) 
* ''2%'' [[Roma people|Roma]] (36 to 40 thousand) (see also [[Roma in Mitrovica Camps]])
* ''1%'' [[Turkish people|Turks]] (18 to 20 thousand)
However, the figures are highly disputable. Some estimates are that there is an Albanian majority well above 90 percent. Others give much higher figures for Roma and Turks [http://www.siri-us.com/backgrounders/Archives_Kosovo/Kosovo-Milosevic.html][http://www.salon.com/news/1999/03/31newsa.html][http://www.serbianunity.net/news/world_articles/Dragnich1098.html]
