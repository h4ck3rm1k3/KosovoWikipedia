'''Kosovo''' &lt;!--Please leave the following language order as Albanian followed by Serbian: this is alphabetical and as neutral as we can get; Albanian is also the primary language of the region--&gt;({{lang-sq|Kosova}} or ''Kosovë'', {{lang-sr|Косово}}, ''Kosovo'') is a self-declared independent republic in [[southeastern Europe]]. After [[Kosovo status process|international negotiations]] failed to reach a consensus on an acceptable [[constitutional status of Kosovo|constitutional status]], [[Provisional Institutions of Self-Government|Kosovo's provisional government]] unilaterally [[declaration of independence|declared independence]] from [[Serbia]] on [[17 February]] [[2008]], terming itself as the '''Republic of Kosovo''' ({{lang-sq|Republika e Kosovës}}, {{lang-sr|Република Косово}}, ''Republika Kosovo''). The new state is anticipated to receive [[Foreign relations of Kosovo|partial international recognition]] from most European countries, the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200802070076.html |title=Japan to recognize independence of Kosovo from Serbia |publisher=Asahi Shimbun |date= 2008-02-07 |accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to be opposed by [[Russia]] and [[People's Republic of China]] and without recognition by the [[United Nations]]. The Serbian government regards the territory as an integral part of Serbia, the '''Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija''' ({{lang-sr|Аутономна покрајина Косово и Метохија}}, ''Autonomna pokrajina Kosovo i Metohija'', also Космет, ''Kosmet''; {{lang-sq|Krahina Autonome e Kosovës dhe Metohisë}}).

Following the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244|Resolution 1244]] placed Kosovo under the authority of the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK), with security provided by the [[NATO]]-led [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR). Although the Resolution legally affirmed Serbia's [[sovereignty]] over Kosovo, in practice Serbian governance in the region has been virtually non-existent since then. UNMIK's role in Kosovo is in the process of being superseded by [[EULEX]], a [[European Union]] body. KFOR continues to provide security. The legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence is disputed by Serbia, which also opposes the EU's takeover of UNMIK's responsibilities. The international community is divided on the issue, with Russia and several EU members backing Serbia's position.

In addition to its frontier with the rest of Serbia, Kosovo borders [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], and the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It has a population of just over two million people, predominantly ethnic [[Albanians]], with smaller populations of  [[Serbs]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Romani people]], [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorani]]s, [[Bosniaks]] and other ethnic communities. [[Pristina]] is the capital and largest city.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Kosovo}}

[[Image:Kosovo stamp.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Postage stamp]] from Kosovo issued after the 1999 Kosovo War.]]

Kosovo has one of the most under-developed economies in Europe, with a per capita income estimated at [[Euro|€]]1,565 (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20629286~menuPK:297777~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=Kosovo Brief 2006 |author=The World Bank |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite substantial development subsidies from all Yugoslav republics, Kosovo was the poorest province of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1982-01-15, &quot;Why Turbulent Kosovo has Marble Sidewalks but Troubled Industries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, over the course of the 1990s a blend of poor economic policies, international sanctions, poor external commerce and ethnic conflict severely damaged the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/KOSOVOEXTN/0,,menuPK:297775~pagePK:141159~piPK:141110~theSitePK:297770,00.html |title=World Bank Mission in Kosovo |author=The World Bank |date=2006/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo's economy remains weak. After a jump in 2000 and 2001, growth in [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) was negative in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to be around 3 percent 2004-2005, with domestic sources of growth unable to compensate for the declining foreign assistance. [[Inflation]] is low, while the budget posted a deficit for the first time in 2004. Kosovo has high external deficits. In 2004, the deficit of the balance of goods and services was close to 70 percent of GDP. Remittances from Kosovars living abroad accounts for an estimated 13 percent of GDP, and foreign assistance for around 34 percent of GDP.

Most economic development since 1999 has taken place in the trade, retail and the construction sectors. The private sector that has emerged since 1999 is mainly small-scale. The industrial sector remains weak and the electric power supply remains unreliable, acting as a key constraint. Unemployment remains pervasive, at around 40-50% of the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eciks.org/english/lajme.php?action=total_news&amp;main_id=386 |title=May finds Kosovo with 50% unemployed |author=eciks |date=04/05/06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNMIK introduced ''de-facto'' an external trade regime and customs administration on [[September 3]], [[1999]] when it set customs border controls in Kosovo. All goods imported in Kosovo face a flat 10% customs duty fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyUSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buyusa.gov/kosovo/en/doingbusinessinkosovo.html |title=Doing Business in Kosovo |author=U.S. Commercial Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; These taxes are collected from all Tax Collection Points installed at the borders of Kosovo, including those between Kosovo and  Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seerecon.org/kosovo/documents/wb_econ_report/wb-kosovo-econreport-2-2.pdf |format=PDF |title=External Trade and Customs |author=Economic Reconstruction and Development in South East Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNMIK and Kosovo institutions have signed Free Trade Agreements with [[Croatia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/globe-article.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=123&amp;nav_id=37090 |title=Croatia, Kosovo sign Interim Free Trade Agreement |author=B92 |authorlink=B92 |date=02/10/06 |publisher=mrt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/upload_press/4.06%20-%20UNMIK%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20Initial%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement%2017.2.06.pdf |format=PDF |title=UNMIK and Bosnia and Herzegovina Initial Free Trade Agreement |author=EU in Kosovo |date=17/02/06 |publisher=UNMIK}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BuyUSA&quot;/&gt;

The [[Republic of Macedonia]] is Kosovo's largest import and export market (averaging €220 million and €9 million, respectively), followed by Serbia-Montenegro (€111 million and €5 million), Germany and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTKOSOVO/147270-1121700806276/20953280/Kosovo_Economic_Briefing_april.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo Monthly Economic Briefing: Preparing for next winter |author=The World Bank |date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[euro]] is the official currency of Kosovo and used by UNMIK and the government bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euinkosovo.org/uk/invest/invest.php |title=Invest in Kosovo |author=EU in Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Serbian dinar]] is used in the Serbian-populated parts.

The economy is hindered by Kosovo's still-unresolved international status, which has made it difficult to attract investment and loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4509781.stm |title=Brussels offers first Kosovo loan |author=BBC News |date=03/05/05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The province's economic weakness has produced a thriving black economy in which smuggled petrol, cigarettes and cement are major commodities. The prevalence of official corruption and the pervasive influence of organised crime gangs has caused serious concern internationally. The United Nations has made the fight against corruption and organised crime a high priority, pledging a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; approach.

== Demographics ==
[[Image:Kosovo ethnic 2005.png|right|thumb|180px|Ethnic composition of Kosovo in [[2005]] according to the [[OSCE]].]]
{{main|Demographic history of Kosovo}}

According to the Kosovo in Figures 2005 Survey of the Statistical Office of Kosovo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks-gov.net/esk/esk/pdf/english/general/kosovo_figures_05.pdf |format=PDF |title=Kosovo in figures 2005 |author=UNMIK |publisher=Ministry of Public Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |author=BBC News |date=23/12/05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=Regions and territories: Kosovo |author=BBC News |date=20/11/07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo's total population is estimated between 1.9 and 2.2 million in the following ethnic proportions (but many pre-1999 Kosovar Serbs and individuals from other ethnic groups originally from Kosovo now live in [[Central Serbia]], about 250.000-350.000). The estimate from 2000-2002-2003 goes (a 1,900,000 strong population):
* 92% [[Albanians]]  
* 4% [[Serbs]]
* 2% [[Bosniaks]] and [[Gorani (ethnic group)|Gorans]]
* 1% [[Roma people|Roma]]
* 1% [[Turkish people|Turks]]

[[Islam]] is the predominant faith, professed by most of the majority ethnic Albanian population; the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities; and some of the Roma/[[Ashkali]]/[[Egyptians|Egyptian]] community, although religion is not a significant factor in public life. Religious rhetoric was largely absent from public discourse in Muslim communities, mosque attendance was low, and public displays of conservative Islamic dress and culture were minimal. The Serb population, estimated at 100,000 to 120,000 persons, is largely [[Serbian Orthodox]]. Approximately 3 percent of ethnic Albanians are [[Roman Catholic]]. Catholic communities are concentrated around Catholic churches in [[Prizren]], [[Klina]], and [[Gjakova]]. [[Protestant]]s make up less than 1 percent of the population and have small populations in most cities, with the largest concentration located in Pristina. There are no synagogues or [[Jewish]] institutions; there are reportedly two families whose members have Jewish roots. The number of [[atheist]]s or those who do not practice any religion are difficult to determine, and estimates are largely unreliable.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=1591&amp;l=1 |title=Religion in Kosovo |author=International Crisis Group |date=31/01/01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90198.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2007 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71405.htm#kosovo International Religious Freedom Report 2006 (U.S. Department of States) - Serbia and Montenegro (includes Kosovo)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have the largest population growth in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/3-13-10.shtml Albanian Population Growth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srpska-mreza.com/Kosovo/demographic-explosion.html Demographic explosion in Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt; The people’s growth rate in Kosovo is 1.3%. Over an 82-year period (1921-2003) the population grew 4.6 times. If growth continues at such a pace, based on some estimations, the population will be 4.5 million by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kosovo-hotels.com/index.php?mod=kos_profile Kosovo-Hotels, Prishtina - Kosova-Hotels, Prishtinë]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
===Music===
: ''See also: [[List of Albanians#Musicians|Albanian and Kosovo, Albanian musicians]], [[Music of Kosovo]], [[Music of Serbia]], [[List of Serbian musicians]]
Although in Kosovo the music is diverse (influenced to an extent by the cultures of the various regimes who controlled the region), authentic Albanian music (see ''[[World Music]]'') and [[Serbian music]] do still exist. Albanian music is characterized by the use of the ''[[çiftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolin'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''. In Kosovo, [[folk]] music is very popular alongside modern music. There are a number of folk [[singers]] and ensembles (both Albanian and Serbian). [[European classical music|Classical music]] is also well known in Kosovo and has been taught at [[universities]] (at the [[University of Prishtina#Albanian university|University of Priština Faculty of Arts]]  and the [[University of Pristina#Serbian university|University of Priština at Kosovska Mitrovica]]  [[Faculty of Arts of Priština|Faculty of Arts]]) and several pre-[[college]] [[List of pre-college music schools|music school]]s

There are some notable music festivals in Kosovo:
* ''Rock për Rock'' - contains [[Rock (music)|rock]] and [[Heavy Metal music|metal]] music
* ''Polifest'' - contains all kinds of genres (usually [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and commercial [[Pop (music)|pop]])
* ''Showfest'' - contains all kinds of genres (usually [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and commercial [[Pop (music)|pop]])
* ''Videofest'' - contains all kinds of genres
* ''Kush Këndon Lutet Dy Herë'' - contains [[Christian music]]
* ''North City Jazz &amp; Blues festival'', an international [[music festival]] held annually in [[Zvečan]] ({{lang-sq|Zveçani}}), near Kosovska Mitrovica,
Kosovo Radiotelevisions like ''RTK'', ''21'' and ''KTV'' have their musical charts.

===Sport===
Several sports federations have been formed in Kosovo within the framework of Law No. 2003/24 &quot;Law on Sport&quot; passed by the Assembly of Kosovo in 2003. The law formally established a national Olympic Committee, regulated the establishment of sports federations and established guidelines for sports clubs. At present only some of the sports federations established have gained international recognition.

Federations that have so far gained membership or recognition by their international governing body:
* [[Handball Federation of Kosovo]]
* [[Table Tennis Federation of Kosovo]]

Federations that have not yet gained international recognition:
* [[Basketball Federation of Kosovo]]
* [[Football Federation of Kosovo]] and the [[Kosovo national football team]]
* [[Olympic Committee of Kosovo]]
* [[Tennis Federation of Kosovo]]
